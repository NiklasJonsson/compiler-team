## WG checkins

@**WG-rls2.0** checkin by @**matklad**:

> Checkin text

@**WG-self-profile** checkin by @**Wesley Wiser**:

Things have settled down quite a lot since the last check-in.
We achieved our MVP goal and since then, lots of people have been using the tools either directly or via the perf.rlo integration.

I think the only major news is that we have documentation everwhere that has been requested:

- GitHub readme files for each individual tool.
- `rustc -Zhelp` has some short help text describing the options.
- The Unstable Book has [more complete](https://doc.rust-lang.org/unstable-book/compiler-flags/self-profile.html) documentation about the `-Z` flags.
- Rustc Dev Guide has a [mention](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/profiling.html).

I also wrote a rather extensive post on the [Inside-Rust blog](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/02/25/intro-rustc-self-profile.html) about the tooling including a complete step-by-step tutorial.

While there additional polish that could be done, there are no remaining "must-have" features that I'm aware of.
