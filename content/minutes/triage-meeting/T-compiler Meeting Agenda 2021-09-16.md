## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2021-09-14](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-09-14.md)

Fairly busy week, with some large improvements on several benchmarks. Several larger rollups landed, in part due to recovery from a temporary CI outage, which has complicated some of the performance monitoring work. These should, however, now be resolved.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**. 2 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 5 Mixed; 2 of them in rollups
31 comparisons made in total

#### Regressions

Encode spans relative to the enclosing item [#84373](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/84373)

- Large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=8c2b6ea37d7719a0370bd404030eef9702c1752c&end=547d9374d26f203ab963b3ffe1ed36bd70f16633&stat=instructions:u) (up to 2.1% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `tuple-stress`)
- Regressions are much smaller on "full" benchmarks (<0.5%). This support has
  also landed gated behind a -Z flag, so the incremental cost is being paid
  without the possible wins.

Rollup of 7 pull requests [#88881](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88881)

- Large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=9ef27bf7dc50a8b51435579b4f2e86f7ee3f7a94&end=c7dbe7a830100c70d59994fd940bf75bb6e39b39&stat=instructions:u) (up to 2.1% on `full` builds of `inflate`)
- No clear cause. Investigation is partially ongoing, but may warrant an
  assignee -- there's several possible candidates.

#### Improvements

- Rollup of 10 pull requests [#88857](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88857)
- Use FxHashSet instead of Vec for well formed tys [#88771](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88771)

#### Mixed

Split rustc_mir [#80522](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80522)

- Large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=47ae8deb8a35030bdc4e502b03400800864cc264&end=97032a6dfacdd3548e4bff98c90a6b3875a14077&stat=instructions:u) (up to -2.0% on `full` builds of `deeply-nested-async`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=47ae8deb8a35030bdc4e502b03400800864cc264&end=97032a6dfacdd3548e4bff98c90a6b3875a14077&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.8% on `full` builds of `await-call-tree`)
- Mixed results. Noted in a comment that this also was a slight regression in
  bootstrap time as measured by perf.rust-lang.org, which seems unfortunate and
  may merit some investigation.

Rollup of 15 pull requests [#88824](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88824)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=b69fe57261086e70aea9d5b58819a1794bf7c121&end=22719efcc570b043f2e519d6025e5f36eab38fe2&stat=instructions:u) (up to -0.7% on `incr-patched: println` builds of `html5ever`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=b69fe57261086e70aea9d5b58819a1794bf7c121&end=22719efcc570b043f2e519d6025e5f36eab38fe2&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.0% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `derive`)
- Report seems a little bit close to noise, and is definitely mixed. No clear
  cause, but also a fairly large rollup.

Refactor query forcing [#78780](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78780)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=43769af69e43d0fb9770f0a392671f000595df78&end=8c2b6ea37d7719a0370bd404030eef9702c1752c&stat=instructions:u) (up to -0.9% on `incr-full` builds of `unused-warnings`)
- Small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=43769af69e43d0fb9770f0a392671f000595df78&end=8c2b6ea37d7719a0370bd404030eef9702c1752c&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.3% on `incr-patched: println` builds of `coercions`)
- Solid improvement in rustc_query_impl compile times (8%). Overall looks like
  results are overall more of an improvement than a regression.

Update LLVM submodule [#88765](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88765)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=0273e3bce7a0ce49e96a9662163e2380cb87e0be&end=0212c70b1df2aa542aef48d5fcde0af3734970c6&stat=instructions:u) (up to -0.7% on `full` builds of `ctfe-stress-4`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=0273e3bce7a0ce49e96a9662163e2380cb87e0be&end=0212c70b1df2aa542aef48d5fcde0af3734970c6&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.7% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `ripgrep`)
- Fairly mixed results, no clear picture either way.
