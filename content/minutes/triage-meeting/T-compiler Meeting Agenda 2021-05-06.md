### WG checkins

- @_wg-incr-comp_ by @**pnkfelix** and @**Wesley Wiser**:

> The incr-comp working group will be shifting to having its bi-weekly meetings [on zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/241847-t-compiler.2Fwg-incr-comp/topic/change.20meeting.20time.20or.20other.20changes.20to.20drive.20engagement/near/235333445) instead of zoom.
>
> Since the last checkin (on [25 march 2021](https://hackmd.io/UZ8VFdqFT0mJtGRnm-Lwmw?view#WG-checkins)), thanks to efforts by cjgillot, we have started streaming the dep-graph to a file instead of storing it in-memory ([PR #82780](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/82780)).

- @_WG-llvm_ checkin by @**nagisa**:
  > Since the LLVM 12's landing there have been a large number of issues. Many were fixed. We also enabled a some features we thought were fixed. So we still have plenty of problems that are still outstanding. We'll have to disable some of those features (mutable-noalias, inline-asm stack probes...) until we've more confidence they're fixed again

## PRs S-waiting-on-team

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AS-waiting-on-team+label%3AT-compiler)

- "Remove unstable `--pretty` flag" [rust#83491](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83491)
  - Should disambiguate and consolidate the usage of two apparently redundant flags (`--unpretty` and `--pretty`) into one
  - Only known usage seems to be in the Rust Playground
  - Reviewed by @**varkor**, suggests removing it from the Rust Playground before landing this (@**Jake Goulding** agrees on removing the flag)
  - [@**Santiago Pastorino** suggests](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83491#issuecomment-831894280) renaming/aliasing the flag to a `--dump-*` to better reflect its purpose

[T-libs-impl](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AS-waiting-on-team+label%3AT-libs-impl)

- "Use try_reserve in Vec's io::Write" [rust#84612](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/84612)
  - Opened by @**Kornel**
  - Assigned for review to @**Mara**, waiting for consensus from T-libs
  - Currently discussing the possible breakage this could cause (although fixing an incorrect behaviour)
  - addressed the concern by [making it a warning](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/84612#issuecomment-833052459) and maybe `io::Error` in the future
