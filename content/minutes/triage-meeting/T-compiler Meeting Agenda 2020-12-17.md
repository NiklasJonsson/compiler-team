### WG checkins

@_WG-llvm_ checkin by @**nagisa**:

> - Subjectively it seems like there has been an uptick of soundness issues/miscompilations related to LLVM (or perhaps people are now trying to use more obscure features of it, new targets?)
> - Besides a regular submodule bump ([#79861](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79861)), there hasn't been much development, notable outstanding and related stuff is: [#77885](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77885) using inline-asm stack probes which is blocked on 11.0.1 and a couple of changes as part of work to enable split dwarf support ([#80087](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80087), [#77117](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77117))

@_T-compiler/WG-meta_ checkin by @**nikomatsakis**:

> - wesleywiser is now the new compiler team co-lead!
> - nikomatsakis floated a proposal around "compiler team officers", the idea being to identify various special roles within compiler team that get elected to fixed terms (including a set of folks who decide on RFCs), and to generally "flatten" the team structure so that contribuors/members both elect these officers
> - The core team roadmap draft is going to focus on governance, such as defining team charters and other work, so nikomatsakis expects next year that meta will take on some of that work
> - One question is whether nikomatsakis should continue as lead of the working group, or whether wesleywiser/pnkfelix (or someone else) would be better! nikomatsakis is open to stepping back from that role, if others are pscyched to fill it, and eager to contribute help and thoughts either way.
> - Enjoy the upcoming holidays and take care of yourselves, folks! :heart_eyes:

## Performance logs

> [triage logs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/tree/master/triage#triage-logs)

A week dominated by small regressions with only 1 modest yet clear performance gain. None of the regressions are large enough to cause concern, but there should be a followup to some to ensure that those regressions are at least examined.

Triage done by **@rylevick**.
Revision range: [4fd4a98d4788bc987d7f7add9df5f5ead6a1c15e..e1cce06e4ff5206daf397e1dcf91ed53653be171](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=4fd4a98d4788bc987d7f7add9df5f5ead6a1c15e&end=e1cce06e4ff5206daf397e1dcf91ed53653be171&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

6 Regressions, 1 Improvements, 2 Mixed
0 of them in rollups

### Regressions

Also generate `StorageDead` in constants[#78679](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78679)

- Large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=c0bfe3485f97f267cc8adec724f109c56dab5526&end=cc03ee6702053ded253c3656cbd02f0bfdf25c73&stat=instructions:u) (up to 5.7% on `incr-patched: new row` builds of `tuple-stress-check`)
- A removal of special casing of not marking statics and constants as `StorageDead` inside rustc_mir.
- This was regression was [deemed as acceptable](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78679#issuecomment-729030782) due to being more correct than the previous implementation.

Properly re-use def path hash in incremental mode[#79721](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79721)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=cc03ee6702053ded253c3656cbd02f0bfdf25c73&end=fa55f668e5ea5388ec98b9340969527252239151&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.5% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `deeply-nested-opt`)
- Fixes a p-high [ICE issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79661), and so the perf regressions were deemed acceptable.
- This is a fix for [#74967](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74967) which saw [large perf gains](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=db79d2f63780613e700cb58b4339c48287555ae0&end=bf8e95436e60effbeb46a32e17df8ab7fcb0c6ad).

Accept arbitrary expressions in key-value attributes at parse time[#78837](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78837)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=1cc410710993d036730c11556039e40109f6ab41&end=58d2bad9f7ab0971495247b6c94978848760ca9d&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.4% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `match-stress-exhaustive_patterns-check`)
- [Pinged in the PR about this issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78837#issuecomment-745380762)

Capture precise paths in THIR and MIR[#79553](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79553)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=9eb3a7ceafd1e2c1924177caa18c7cc0c25b413e&end=5bd9b60333b3dc0a51e7a5607cd1e0d537a9f718&stat=instructions:u) (up to 4.5% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `clap-rs-check`)
- While this change powers a feature behind a feature flag (`capture_disjoint_fields`), it looks like it's still causing perf regressions in workloads not using this feature.
- This is a known issue with [a plan](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79553#issuecomment-745437806) for how to recover the performance loss.

Create `rustc_type_ir`[#79169](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79169)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=c3ed6681ff8d446e68ce272be4bf66f4145f6e29&end=3f2088aa603d2cd3f43c20795872de9cd6ec7735&stat=instructions:u) (up to 3.1% on `full` builds of `ctfe-stress-4-check`)

* This mainly seems to be moving code around so it might be an inlining issue.
* [Pinged in the PR about this issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79169#issuecomment-745388674)

Update stdarch submodule[#79938](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79938)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=fa416394275d2468d104b8f72ac31b1ddf7ee52e&end=8b3ee82eb68cb35030bb745c23f8aa76d9de5bee&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.4% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `deeply-nested-debug`)
- This was a wholesale update of the stdarch submodule.
- stdarch is using const arguments that would benefit from const generics. This might explain why compilation suffers.

* [Pinged in the PR about this issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79938#issuecomment-745393740)

### Improvements

Compress RWU from at least 32 bits to 4 bits[#79727](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79727)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=5e6e1e33a11d140a4d70f946730137f241224eb3&end=1700ca07c6dd7becff85678409a5df6ad4cf4f47&stat=instructions:u) (up to -4.8% on `full` builds of `clap-rs-check`)
- This was explicitly an experiment to gain performance, and it seems to worked fairly well. Other bit representations were tested but the one chosen was the most efficient.

### Mixed

Use `def_path_hash_to_def_id` when re-using a `RawDefId`[#79915](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79915)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=a2e29d67c26bdf8f278c98ee02d6cc77a279ed2e&end=19eb1c4c526071c430c05fffc64da71ac057a3d5&stat=instructions:u) (up to -3.5% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `clap-rs-check`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=a2e29d67c26bdf8f278c98ee02d6cc77a279ed2e&end=19eb1c4c526071c430c05fffc64da71ac057a3d5&stat=instructions:u) (up to 2.7% on `incr-patched: dummy fn` builds of `unused-warnings-check`)
- The amount of regressions outweighs the improvements (which were just in the clap benchmark).
- This is a followup fix to [#79721](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79721). Overall these regressions still represent a perf gain when compared to before the changes introduced in [#74967](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74967).

Lower `discriminant_value` intrinsic[#79922](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79922)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=8b3ee82eb68cb35030bb745c23f8aa76d9de5bee&end=5d77fc8d0db3b69f3a3691d86eba23e4cdc390e1&stat=instructions:u) (up to -3.9% on `full` builds of `match-stress-enum-check`)
- Smaller regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=8b3ee82eb68cb35030bb745c23f8aa76d9de5bee&end=5d77fc8d0db3b69f3a3691d86eba23e4cdc390e1&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.3% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `clap-rs-check`)
- The improvement outweighs the regression.

### Nags requiring follow up

- Several regressions need followup investigations. See their respective entries above for the issue.
- As mentioned last week, stdarch expansion causing a 40% libcore compile time regression is still not resolved, and resolution is unclear. This is likely a related issue to the stdarch regression listed above.

## Nominated Issues

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-compiler)

Preamble: there are 3 issues below (#76213, #79246, #79564) somehow all pointing to the same PR [rust#76030](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76030) which exposed an existing [bug in loop vectorize in LLVM](https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=48340). We (as in: me @**apiraino**) are not 100% sure if they are all correlated, but thought to nominate them all to reason about their priority and (if any) find a common theme.
