### WG checkins

@_WG-async-foundations_ checkin by @**nikomatsakis** and @**tmandry**

> The major work has been the [async vision doc](https://rust-lang.github.io/wg-async-foundations/vision.html).
> We now have 30 [status quo stories](https://rust-lang.github.io/wg-async-foundations/vision/status_quo.html), with more on the way.
> We recently announced the start of the [shiny future brainstorming session](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/04/14/async-vision-doc-shiny-future.html).
> If you're interested in participating, you might consider joining one of the [writing sessions](https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2021/04/19/async-vision-doc-writing-sessions-vi/) that are taking place tomorrow, hosted by @**rylev** and @**nikomatsakis**.

@_WG-traits_ checkin by @**nikomatsakis** and @**Jack Huey**

> We've been concentrating on a number of initiatives:
>
> - Creating a standalone library for Rust types: @**Jack Huey** recently landed #76814, which refactored binders so that they have a list of the things which they bind. This helps to align with Chalk's representation and permits us to represent things like `for<'a> fn(i32)`, where the `'a` in the binder doesn't actually appear in the type. Other notable PRs are on the way.
> - Improving chalk: @**FireFighterDuck** landed rust-lang/chalk#698 that fixes coinductive handling in the recursive solver. Movement here has otherwise been slow.
> - Async fn in traits: We created a [project board](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-traits/projects/4) tracking the major blockers and milestones in this effort.
> - Closing various bugs: most notably, @**nikomatsakis** has been working with @**Aaron Hill** on #83913 and with @**Jack Huey** to resolve some problems that arose aftr #76814 landed.
>
> Office hours: We've also designed some regular blocks ("office hours") where @**nikomatsakis** and others are around and working on tasks. There is one general office hours and the other is designed for async fn in traits. Check the compiler team calendar for details.

## Performance logs

> [2021-04-21 triage logs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-04-21.md)

Another quiet week with very small changes to compiler performance.

Triage done by **@rylev**. 1 Regressions, 0 Improvements, 1 Mixed, 0 of them in rollups

#### Regressions

Fix lookahead with None-delimited group [#84130](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/84130)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=7537b20626100e7e7fc8c4ad3079d38c05338121&end=16bf626a31cb5b121d0bca2baa969b4f67eb0dab&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.4% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `deep-vector-check`)
- While this change fixes a bug, it does introduce moderate regressions in runtime performance on some benchmarks and a fairly large regression on the compilation of the rustc_parse crate itself.
- We will [follow up](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/84130#issuecomment-823898920) on this particularly in the matter of `rustc_parse`'s compilation times regressing.

#### Improvements

- none

#### Mixed

Add some #[inline(always)] to arithmetic methods of integers [#84061](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/84061)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=392ba2ba1a7d6c542d2459fb8133bebf62a4a423&end=83ca4b7e600241850e61be48dee859f1604de50d&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.7% on `full` builds of `regex-debug`)
- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=392ba2ba1a7d6c542d2459fb8133bebf62a4a423&end=83ca4b7e600241850e61be48dee859f1604de50d&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.3% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `cargo-check`)
- This change inlines a bunch of code that might not have been previously. It's not really a surprise that codegen now is taking longer to churn through all those inline calls.
- While this tradeoff on compile times for runtime performance is likely worth it, we are [checking in with the PR author and reviewer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/84061#issuecomment-823908561) to make sure this is discussed.

#### Nags requiring follow up
