## Performance logs

[Triage done by njn](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/tree/master/triage#triage-logs).
Latest revision: 0c03aee8b81185d65b5821518661c30ecdb42de5.
One unimportant regression, on a rollup; six improvements, two on rollups.

Regressions

- [Rollup of 12 pull requests #74073](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74073#issuecomment-654524169)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=2753fab7ce3647033146b07c8b6c9f4856a910b0&end=0c03aee8b81185d65b5821518661c30ecdb42de5&stat=instructions:u)):
  Up to 1.9% losses, but only on the synthetic `wf-projection-stress-65510`
  benchmark, which doesn't matter that much.

Improvements

- [Serialize all foreign `SourceFile`s into proc-macro crate metadata #73706](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73706#issuecomment-653771986)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=16957bd4d3a5377263f76ed74c572aad8e4b7e59&end=d462551a8600e57d8b6f87e71ea56868bc5da6cf&stat=instructions:u)):
  Up to 7.5% wins across numerous benchmarks, mostly the shorter-running ones.
- [Handle inactive enum variants in `MaybeUninitializedPlaces` #73879](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73879#issuecomment-651710137)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=0cd7ff7ddfb75a38dca81ad3e76b1e984129e939&end=2753fab7ce3647033146b07c8b6c9f4856a910b0&stat=instructions:u)):
  Up to 7.1% wins across numerous benchmarks, mostly on opt builds. (Plus one
  21% improvement, but that benchmark has high variability.)
- [Rollup of 16 pull requests #73950](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73950#issuecomment-654520286)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=9491f18c5de3ff1c4bf9c3fdacf52d9859e26f7c&end=b7856f695d65a8ebc846754f97d15814bcb1c244&stat=instructions:u)):
  Up to 1.9% wins across numerous benchmarks.
- [Avoid `unwrap_or_else` in `RawVec::allocate_in`. #73882](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73882#issue-441778949)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=5f4abc16e1b2cb035eee6a5079ce45ce924c1f33&end=cd1a46d644791c79433db934ad4e6131c577efcc&stat=instructions:u)):
  Up to 1.2% wins across a few benchmarks, mostly on debug builds. Maybe
  [#73345](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73345) or
  [#73569](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73569) is responsible?
- [Remove `TypeckTables::empty(None)` and make hir_owner non-optional. #73751](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73751#issuecomment-654521841)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=8a6d4342be6a6acbade8e7ef65e73d27ee8c9144&end=3503f565e1fb7296983757d2716346f48a4a262b&stat=instructions:u)):
  Up to 3.8% wins, mostly on `unused-warnings`.
- [Rollup of 17 pull requests #73924](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73924#issuecomment-654518483)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=d462551a8600e57d8b6f87e71ea56868bc5da6cf&end=f781babf87dea29c44f93842b7ac9eb809549d29&stat=instructions:u)):
  Up to 1.9% wins, mostly on `clap-rs`. Unclear which PR is responsible.

## Nominated Issues

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-compiler)

- "Inherit `#[stable(..)]` annotations in enum variants and fields from its item" [rust#71481](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71481)
  - Assigned to: @**Matthew Jasper**
  - Is a PR to allow stability attributes flow down in enums to their variants and fields
  - Nominated because it's controversial
    - [@**Vadim Petrochenkov** believes is not a good idea](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71481#issuecomment-625423500)
    - [@**nagisa** believes it's dangerous and also limits our possibilities in the future](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71481#discussion_r436266259)
    - [@**nikomatsakis** expressed that we might accidentally stabilize struct fields without intending to](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71481#discussion_r439594190)
- "A big regression in tokio-webpush-simple-opt" [rust#58368](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/58368)
  - Tokio webpush bench regressed 88.5% [in this commit](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/ff19a53ef07566aa30860023f6eac6e75ffaf900).
  - Nominated to raise awareness of such a big performance regression with no recent activity.
- PR's "Avoid "blacklist"" [rust#74150](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74150) and "Avoid "whitelist"" [rust#74127](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74127)
  - Felix nominated: these ended up being troll-magnets. Felix wants to establish that this kind of PR is in line with our values, for the reasons [posted by niko](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74127#pullrequestreview-444766034).
    - Felix asks: Would others agree with this statement, taken from ["The light and dark of language"](https://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2009/12/light-and-dark-2.html)? :
      > For what itâs worth, we donât believe that metaphors identifying lightness as positive and darkness as negative are inherently racist. They certainly didnât begin that way, though these negative connotations have certainly fed into and reinforced racism over the centuries.
  - (Also, as previously established, the Core Team has publicly noted support for BLM in the [1.44.0 blog post](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/06/04/Rust-1.44.0.html))
  - ~~Assuming they both land, pnkfelix proposes we lock them both again after they land, because even now they continue to invite trolling or troll-like behavior.~~

[libs-impl](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-nominated+label%3Alibs-impl)

- No nominated issues for libs-impl this time.
