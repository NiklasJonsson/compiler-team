### WG checkins

@_WG-prioritization_ checkin by @**Santiago Pastorino**:

> - We published last week a [Call for new contributors](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/09/14/wg-prio-call-for-contributors.html). The answer was above our expectations, to this day we have received 13 new applications and we are therefore encouraging new volunteers showing up to also join the [Cleanup crew group](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/notification-groups/cleanup-crew.html).
> - Most of our procedures and work have settled now and not many huge things are happening other than our day to day work.

@_WG-rfc-2229_ checkin by @**Aman Arora** and @**nikomatsakis**:

> - Most of the infrastructure to capture Places is in now
> - Work resumed after the break, all existing branches revived.
> - Progress on updating how closures are printed (for non-verbose just removing upvar types)
> - New capture analysis verified to not break existing functionality (all tests up to stage1 tests pass).

## Performance logs

This was the first week of semi-automated perf triage, and thank goodness:
There was a lot going on. Most regressions are either quite small or already
have a fix published.

[#72412](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/72412) is probably the most
interesting case. It fixes a pathological problem involving nested closures by
adding cycle detection to what seems to be a relatively hot part of the code.
As a result, most users will see a slight [compile-time
regression](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=2c69266c0697b0c0b34abea62cba1a1d3c59c90c&end=fdc3405c20122fd0f077f5a77addabc873f20e4c&stat=task-clock)
for their crates.

Triage done by **@ecstaticmorse**.
Revision range: [dbb73f8f79ab176a897d5a95e696adb71b957cbe..b01326ab033e41986d4a5c8b96ce4f40f3b38e30](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=dbb73f8f79ab176a897d5a95e696adb71b957cbe&end=b01326ab033e41986d4a5c8b96ce4f40f3b38e30&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

- A fix has been published as [#76913](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76913).

[#72412](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/72412) Issue 72408 nested closures exponential

- Very large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=2c69266c0697b0c0b34abea62cba1a1d3c59c90c&end=fdc3405c20122fd0f077f5a77addabc873f20e4c&stat=instructions:u)

  (up to 1.5% on `full` builds of `coercions-check`)
- Fixes a pathological case, but slows down normal builds slightly.
- Might be worth investigating to see if we can do better, although the author seems to have done a pretty thorough job.

[#74949](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74949) Validate constants during `const_eval_raw`

- Very large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=10b3595ba6a4c658c9dea105488fc562c815e434&end=5e449b9adff463455743291b0c1f76feec092992&stat=instructions:u)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=81e02708f1f4760244756548981277d5199baa9a&end=2e0edc0f28c5647141bedba02e7a222d3a5dc9c3&stat=instructions:u)
  (up to -1.6% on `full` builds of `style-servo-opt`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=81e02708f1f4760244756548981277d5199baa9a&end=2e0edc0f28c5647141bedba02e7a222d3a5dc9c3&stat=instructions:u)
  (up to 1.3% on `full` builds of `wf-projection-stress-65510-check`)
- Seems to have been a regression overall. If there's no improvment in the generated code, we should disable this.
