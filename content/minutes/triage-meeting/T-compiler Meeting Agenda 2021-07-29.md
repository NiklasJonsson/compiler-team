### WG checkins

- @_wg-incr-comp_ by @**pnkfelix** @**Wesley Wiser**

  > The working group has been largely dormant. pnkfelix is hoping to fire things up again, and is [seeking input](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/241847-t-compiler.2Fwg-incr-comp/topic/what.E2.80.99s.20best.20way.20to.20drive.20conversation.20here.3F/near/247287693) about when/how to drive activity.

## Backport nominations

[T-compiler stable](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Abeta-nominated+-label%3Abeta-accepted+label%3AT-compiler) / [T-compiler beta](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Astable-nominated+-label%3Astable-accepted+label%3AT-compiler)

- :beta: "Always preserve sub-obligations in the projection cache" [rust#85868](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/85868)
  - [discussed last week](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/238009-t-compiler.2Fmeetings/topic/.5Bweekly.5D.202021-07-22.20.2354818/near/246855877)
  - Discussion seems was oriented to not backport this to 1.54, to re-enable incr-comp (at least we now have more useful error messages) and attempt to merge it into next beta 1.55
  - makes sense to remove beta-backport nomination?
- No stable nominations for `T-compiler` this time.

[T-rustdoc stable](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Abeta-nominated+-label%3Abeta-accepted+label%3AT-rustdoc) / [T-rustdoc beta](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Astable-nominated+-label%3Astable-accepted+label%3AT-rustdoc)

- No beta nominations for `T-rustdoc` this time.
- No stable nominations for `T-rustdoc` this time.

## Performance logs

> [triage logs 2021-07-27](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-07-27.md)

A very quiet week with only improvements. There was one possible regression, but it was removed from consideration due to only barely impacting a somewhat noisy stress-test benchmark. Untriaged pull requests continue to pile up, but there is still not a good process for dealing with them.

Triage done by **@rylev**.

0 Regressions, 3 Improvements, 0 Mixed; 0 of them in rollups

#### Regressions

Support HIR wf checking for function signatures [#87265](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87265)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=7db08eeb0057de86ea2bdbd4c3a085cb8516b653&end=7c89e389d00cfc7e86ae7e1b45880da4f5f5c9f5&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.1% on `full` builds of `externs-opt`)
- Given that this only impacts the somewhat noisy `externs` stress-test benchmark, it's not clear that we should treat this as an actual regression.

#### Improvements

- Improve caching during trait evaluation [#86946](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86946)
- Make mir borrowck's use of opaque types independent of the typeck query's result [#87287](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87287)
- Store all HIR owners in the same container [#83723](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83723)

#### Mixed

None

#### Untriaged Pull Requests

- [#87244 Better diagnostics with mismatched types due to implicit static lifetime](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87244)
- [#86777 Include terminators in instance size estimate](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/86777)
- [#86698 Move OnDiskCache to rustc_query_impl.](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/86698)
- [#86588 Rollup of 8 pull requests](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/86588)
- [#86034 Change entry point to 🛡️ against 💥 💥-payloads](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/86034)
- [#84560 Inline Iterator as IntoIterator.](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/84560)

#### Nags requiring follow up

None

## Nominated Issues

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-compiler)

- "Binary size is significant increased from `1.46.0` to `1.51.0`" [rust#86610](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86610)
  - briefly mentioned last week, discussion postponed to this week
  - issue nominated as FIY for T-compiler
  - perhaps related to one or more issues about the same theme (see mentioned issues, ex. [rust#86431](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86431) was mentioned)
  - Actionable for this issue? Can this be tracked in perf? Worth a `P-high` to keep it visible on the radar?

[RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-compiler)

- No nominated RFCs for `T-compiler` this time.
