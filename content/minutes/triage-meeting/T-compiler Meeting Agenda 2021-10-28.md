### WG checkins

- @_WG-mir-opt_ checkin by @**oli** ([previous checkin](https://hackmd.io/0z3bxGHlQwSYrLNm5ap2Lg#WG-checkins)):

  > We have moved to a "merge fast" policy for new mir opts. This means we add them behind mir-opt-level=4 (very unstable, probably unsound) without necessarily reviewing them with the detail required for anything we expose to users. This allows us to quickly move ahead with new opts without burdening the author with too much rebasing due to mir tests changing under them.
  >
  > #90016 is an optimization currently WIP that uses dataflow to figure out when a match arm is unreachable. This is a very simple form of VRA (value range analysis) that only works for matches on integers, bools and chars, but it is expected to become more powerful and be able to handle enums and comparisons, too.

- @_wg-polymorphization_ checkin by @**davidtwco** ([previous checkin](https://hackmd.io/0z3bxGHlQwSYrLNm5ap2Lg#WG-checkins)):
  > There's a polymorphization update! Surprise!
  >
  > - @\__davidtwco_ submitted #89426 which makes polymorphization pass tests on master, removes some special-case predicate logic that isn't necessary now (after earlier work on the v0 mangling scheme that landed many months ago), and makes the `unused_generic_params` query work on instances rather than just functions (so that shims can be polymorphized). Approved and merged by @\_lcnr.
  > - @_lcnr_ is working on a fix for #75325, this is the primary blocker for polymorphization, and the fix should enable greater polymorphization in the long run. Work-in-progress PR at #90057, and some rough sketches of the design [in a HackMD document](https://hackmd.io/CJ2zzXm0RtGORidx83RtBg).

## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2021-10-26](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-10-26.md)

Multiple regressions this week, several of which were in rollups, without much to balance them out on the improvements front.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [d45ed7502ad225739270a368528725930f54b7b6..3c8f001d454b1b495f7472d8430ef8fdf10aac11](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=d45ed7502ad225739270a368528725930f54b7b6&end=3c8f001d454b1b495f7472d8430ef8fdf10aac11&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

5 Regressions, 4 Improvements, 3 Mixed; 3 of them in rollups; 35 comparisons made in total

#### Regressions

resolve: Use `NameBinding` for local variables and generic parameters [#89100](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89100)

- Very large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=42983a28ab3c70728da7a9b932b667c978dd898d&end=6162529a01473bbb2427fa27354cbafc3c514eee&stat=instructions:u) (up to 99.5% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `style-servo`)
- Reverted in #90130.

Rollup of 6 pull requests [#90235](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90235)

- Very large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=ed08a67566d7d1d9dd2ad928ff21c23e841a4345&end=00d5e42e776da900049fe19087bc9b0057ec70cd&stat=instructions:u) (up to 9.8% on `incr-full` builds of `deeply-nested-async`)
- Probably caused by new compiler-internal lint
  ([#89558](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89558)), which appears to be
  run on end-user code (despite being allow-by-default). Suggested a few
  possible fixes or a revert if we can't do so quickly.

Inline CStr::from_ptr [#90007](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90007)

- Small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=01198792a608b05e624b0127e76dd0753057016c&end=514b3877956dc594823106b66c164f8cdbc8b3da&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.4% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `helloworld`)
- Regression limited to stress tests and fairly minor. Seems likely to be a
  litle extra work in codegen, as the regressions are all in -opt builds. This
  change is done to permit better optimization, skipping a call to strlen in
  some cases, so seems worthwhile.

Implement coherence checks for negative trait impls [#90104](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90104)

- Small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=55ccbd090d96ec3bb28dbcb383e65bbfa3c293ff&end=aa5740c715001f981515ed46faaddebf67cb9539&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.6% on `full` builds of `diesel`)
- Looks like a real regression, but the feature is important and the regression
  is relatively small.

Rollup of 5 pull requests [#90203](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90203)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=aa5740c715001f981515ed46faaddebf67cb9539&end=91b931926fd49fc97d1e39f2b8206abf1d77ce7d&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.6% on `full` builds of `externs`)
- Regression limited to rustdoc, likely due to the addition of code-scraping
  from the examples directory. Does not seem major enough to warrant deep
  investigation, but have left a comment on the likely PR.

#### Improvements

- Adopt let_else across the compiler [#89933](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89933)
- Revert "resolve: Use NameBinding for local variables and generic parameters" [#90130](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90130)
- Specialize HashStable for [u8] slices [#90208](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90208)
- Build the query vtable directly. [#90210](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90210)

#### Mixed

Rollup of 10 pull requests [#90067](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90067)

- Small improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=1af55d19c7a9189374d89472f97dc119659bb67e&end=42983a28ab3c70728da7a9b932b667c978dd898d&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.4% on `incr-patched: println` builds of `coercions`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=1af55d19c7a9189374d89472f97dc119659bb67e&end=42983a28ab3c70728da7a9b932b667c978dd898d&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.1% on `incr-patched: b9b3e592dd cherry picked` builds of `style-servo`)
- Left a comment with a few suggestions, but the regression and improvements
  seem both major and without obvious cause.

Merge the two depkind vtables [#89978](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89978)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=3d71e749a244890cd370d49963e747cf92f4a037&end=efd0483949496b067cd5f7569d1b28cd3d5d3c72&stat=instructions:u) (up to -2.0% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `helloworld`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=3d71e749a244890cd370d49963e747cf92f4a037&end=efd0483949496b067cd5f7569d1b28cd3d5d3c72&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.9% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `clap-rs`)
- Improvements mostly outweigh the regressions

Make new symbol mangling scheme default for compiler itself. [#90054](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90054)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=514b3877956dc594823106b66c164f8cdbc8b3da&end=a3f7c4db0373aa077f86cdd1bf11122845d3b65a&stat=instructions:u) (up to -0.8% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `deeply-nested-async`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=514b3877956dc594823106b66c164f8cdbc8b3da&end=a3f7c4db0373aa077f86cdd1bf11122845d3b65a&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.4% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `deep-vector`)
- Mostly improvements, and digging in is hard since tools like rustfilt have
  slightly different output across the symbol mangling boundary. Regressions
  seem limited to a just a few benchmarks and are small enough that this seems
  acceptable.
