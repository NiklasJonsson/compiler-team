## Performance logs

> [triage full logs for 2021-05-11](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-05-11.md)

Not much change overall - both regressions and improvements were all minor, apart from the 2x compile-time improvement for libcore from PR [#83278](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83278).

We did see a pretty clear 2% improvement in memory usage ([max-rss](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=7a0f1781d04662041db5deaef89598a8edd53717&end=382f748f23979e37e3e012b090e5a0313463f182&absolute=false&stat=max-rss)), and that was again due to PR [#83278](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83278).

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**. 2 Regressions, 3 Improvements, 0 Mixed, 0 of them in rollups

#### Regressions

Integrate attributes as part of the crate hash [#83901](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83901)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=770792ff8d1ec542e78e77876ac936f43ffb8e05&end=467253ff6a2aecd008d273286315ac14ff8ad937&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.6% on `full` builds of `externs-check`)
- There was a regression, seems roughly consistent with the results that we got from the perf run on the PR, so this regression was expected outcome.

Bump stdarch submodule [#83278](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83278)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=ff34b919075f35a1787659e9c448a34b06bab8de&end=881c1ac408d93bb7adaa3a51dabab9266e82eee8&stat=instructions:u) (up to 3.3% on `full` builds of `keccak-debug`)
- There are regressions, but as noted in [PR comments](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83278#issuecomment-835570336), they were not as bad as anticipated. And also, we did continue to see the 2x win on compile-time for libcore.

#### Improvements

- Retain data in vectorized registers for longer [#84915](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/84915)
- lazify backtrace formatting for delayed diagnostics [#84965](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/84965)
- Optimize BufWriter [#79930](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79930)

#### Mixed

- None

#### Nags requiring follow up

No new nags this week, and none leftover from last week.
