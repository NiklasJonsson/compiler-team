## Performance logs

A few small compile-time regressions this week. The first was [#70793](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70793), which added some specializations to the standard library in order to increase runtime performance. The second was [#73996](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73996), which adds an option to the diagnostics code to print only the names of types and traits when they are unique instead of the whole path. The third was [#75200](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75200), which refactored part of `BTreeMap` to avoid aliasing mutable references.

3 Regressions, 0 Improvements, 0 of them in rollups.

#### Regressions

[#75200](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75200)

- A small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=c59199efca5856cdf810919fbf9b5bce32dc4523&end=70c5f6efc445963bbfa5dd53f81c245741eac8cb&stat=instructions:u)

[#73996](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73996)

- A small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=0d0f6b113047b2cf9afbde990cee30fd5b866469&end=af3c6e733a40e671550e0f0f5aeecaa13772ba56&stat=instructions:u)

[#70793](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70793)

- A small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=62dad457bc73804891c6ac9a31f90de19cbb59a3&end=0d0f6b113047b2cf9afbde990cee30fd5b866469&stat=instructions:u) for `check`, `debug` and `opt` benchmarks.
- However, an improvement in `doc` benchmarks, likely due to better optimized standard library.

#### Improvements

- None

- [#75200](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75200)
