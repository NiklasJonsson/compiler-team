# T-compiler Meeting Agenda 2020-04-09

[Tracking Issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54818)

## Announcements

- Tomorrow we have our [planning meeting](https://forge.rust-lang.org/compiler/steering-meeting.html)
- WG-prioritization has created two labels
  - `I-prioritize` so we can ask for prioritization using that label and leave `I-nominated` to nominate issues for discussion. [Read the thread for more info](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/I-nominated.20vs.20I-prioritize)
  - `P-critical`, this will be critical priority issues. We are in the process of documenting our scheme properly but use your judgement and more or less the idea of a critical bug is one that potentially blocks a release.
