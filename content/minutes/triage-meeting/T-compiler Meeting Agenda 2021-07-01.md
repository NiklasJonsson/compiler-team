### WG checkins

@_wg-rfc-2229_ by @nikomatsakis, @matthewjasper

> - Feature is now enabled by default and lint is now part of the edition lint
> - PR approved for -Zprofile-closures which dumps the closure size before and after the feature. This would generate a CSV which can be imported in the [first sheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WUKERwkpJkYhQ-rt0aTQqg-7kcupC7pwKsgxk8v54qc/edit?usp=sharing)
> - Based on profile of rustc we made an optimization to reduce the sizes of closures which seems to be effective. PR [#86701](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/86701) is open right now and has more details.

> Steering issues covered by this checkin:
>
> - https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/8486
> - https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/8972

> Hightlights:
>
> - rust-analyzer now expands attribute-like proc macros.
> - We started a conversation with the core team about moving rust-analyzer to the rust-lang project.
>   Theres little actual progress though, still waiting for the kickoff meeting to get scheduled.
> - We started groundwork to improve code completion quality: added reliable preformance tests, fixed three O(N^2) algorithms, added regression tests for irrelevant completion.
> - We are making good progress on fixing all false errors: https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/8961
>   In general, rust-analyzer now supports most of Rust.
> - We are tentatively thinking about designing the "final" API that the compiler exposes for the IDE:

## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2021-06-30](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-06-30.md)

We only have partial results this week (more details below). From the results we have collected, we have one small regression and several improvements.
Also, there was a broad [max-rss regression](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=29cd70d40722930e66a8b726fe58a7bd1d64a22b&end=6b354a13820a444f834a33365ae4a8d97d7d27ce&stat=max-rss) from 11 days ago and narrower [max-rss regression](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=406d4a9cc3b9601cf98a07c6c83e0227d64f5d48&end=4573a4a879a8e1f773944a8859e4dcd136138af8&stat=max-rss) from 9 days ago.

This week we had some problems with missing benchmark results for some of the commits (we believe this is due to triagebot being out of service for a while). Thus, there is a gap from
[5a7834050f3a0ebcd117b4ddf0bc1e8459594309](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/5a7834050f3a0ebcd117b4ddf0bc1e8459594309) to [7c3872e6bfd555d2ad753ac1f871db3bd7f2a547](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/7c3872e6bfd555d2ad753ac1f871db3bd7f2a547).

The following PR's from that gap were omitted from this analysis.

- [#86467](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86467) - ChrisDenton:win-env-clear, r=JohnTitor
- [#85427](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85427) - ehuss:fix-use-placement, r=jackh726
- [#86279](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86279) - JohnTitor:transparent-zero-size-fields, r=nikomatsakis
- [#86588](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86588) - JohnTitor:rollup-ibgjbkf, r=JohnTitor
- [#86138](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86138) - FabianWolff:issue-85871, r=nikomatsakis
- [#86573](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86573) - Mark-Simulacrum:expat-bump, r=pietroalbini

We have manually enqueued the missing commits for benchmarking on perf.rlo.
