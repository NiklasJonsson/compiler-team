### WG checkins

@_wg-incr-comp_ by @**pnkfelix** and @**Wesley Wiser** ([previous checkin](https://hackmd.io/QCs_hIbpTbKgcSy-0V0Liw)):

> On 20 Aug, wesleywiser mw and pnkfelix met with cjgillot to discuss PR #84373
> It was productive in getting things unblocked, and we hope to have more meetings and progress in the future.

@_WG-llvm_ by @**nagisa** ([previous checkin](https://hackmd.io/QCs_hIbpTbKgcSy-0V0Liw)):

> There was recently a bump to [LLVM 13](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87570), with all of the associated fallout and fixes. There's also an effort to enable the [new pass manager by default](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/88243). This pass manager takes a different tradeoff between space and time, and as a result rustc would use more memory but also optimize code faster.
> In some other news:
>
> - we're considering using the `object` crate in more places to replace some artifact writing functionality we currently use from LLVM.
> - The work towards type-less pointer support has largely happened to the extent it is enabled by LLVM 13.
> - Support for LLVM 10 will likely be dropped in the near future, making LLVM 11 the oldest supported version.

## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2021-09-7](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-09-07.md)

A busy week, with lots of mixed changes, though in the end only a few were deemed significant enough to report here.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**. 3 Regressions, 1 Improvements, 3 Mixed; 0 of them in rollups
57 comparisons made in total

#### Regressions

Shrink Session a bit [#88530](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88530)

- Large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=64929313f53181636e4dd37e25836973205477e4&end=fcce644119cf4e8e36001368e514bb5ed67cb855&stat=instructions:u) (up to 2.6% on `full` builds of `deeply-nested-async`)

Concrete regions can show up in mir borrowck if the originated from there [#88533](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88533)

- Very small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=29ef6cf1637aa8317f8911f93f14e18d404c1b0e&end=a3956106d12cebec91be0637759e29ab6908b4cd&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.0% on `incr-patched: add static arr item` builds of `coercions`)
- This is a small regression to `coercions` and that may be noise. However, there are many others that are over 0.4% regression to instruction counts. The combination of those two factors led pnkfelix to think that we may want to take a second look at the effects of this PR.

Introduce `let...else` [#87688](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87688)

- Small improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=a3956106d12cebec91be0637759e29ab6908b4cd&end=c2a408840ad18f74280805535f0b7193528ff3df&stat=instructions:u) (up to -0.3% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `deeply-nested-closures`)
- Small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=a3956106d12cebec91be0637759e29ab6908b4cd&end=c2a408840ad18f74280805535f0b7193528ff3df&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.4% on `full` builds of `issue-46449`)
- Small regression (approximately 1%) in instruction counts on several of the `*-doc` tests, found via human eye.

#### Improvements

- Move global analyses from lowering to resolution [#88597](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88597)

#### Mixed

Preserve most sub-obligations in the projection cache [#85868](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85868)

- Very large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=b834c4c1bad7521af47f38f44a4048be0a1fe2ee&end=371f3cd3fe523d0b398ed1db1620667c53ba7d02&stat=instructions:u) (up to -6.9% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `deeply-nested`)
- Very large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=b834c4c1bad7521af47f38f44a4048be0a1fe2ee&end=371f3cd3fe523d0b398ed1db1620667c53ba7d02&stat=instructions:u) (up to 9.4% on `full` builds of `deeply-nested`)

BTreeMap/BTreeSet::from_iter: use bulk building to improve the performance [#88448](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88448)

- Large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=11bbb5231349a0a144d86d5c0c21061a06d1969d&end=ffaf857045f4f4d8bb563e0a5077f9b065f42916&stat=instructions:u) (up to -3.0% on `full` builds of `inflate`)
- Large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=11bbb5231349a0a144d86d5c0c21061a06d1969d&end=ffaf857045f4f4d8bb563e0a5077f9b065f42916&stat=instructions:u) (up to 4.5% on `incr-patched: println` builds of `clap-rs`)

Avoid invoking the hir_crate query to traverse the HIR [#88435](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88435)

- Small improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=e30b68353fe22b00f40d021e7914eeb78473b3c1&end=7849e3e9dda60e8ec826ee245c6b180e73911b37&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.2% on `incr-patched: add static arr item` builds of `coercions`)
- Small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=e30b68353fe22b00f40d021e7914eeb78473b3c1&end=7849e3e9dda60e8ec826ee245c6b180e73911b37&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.5% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `helloworld`)
- pnkfelix included this one as notable largely because the expected perf changes from [the actual PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/88435#issuecomment-907700333) largely showed slight improvements across the board, while after it landed on nightly, it is best categorized as "Mixed"
