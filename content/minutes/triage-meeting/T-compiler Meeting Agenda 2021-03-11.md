## Performance logs

[2021-03-10 Triage Log](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-03-10.md)

A generally positive albeit quiet week though many of the perf improvements were gaining performance back from previous regressions. We'll need to continue to keep an eye on rollups as there were two that caused small performance changes.

Triage done by **@rylev**.

1 Regression, 4 Improvements, 1 Mixed
2 of them in rollups

#### Regressions

Rollup of 8 pull requests [#82929](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82929)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=4b9f5cc4c10a161047475cb9bbe02c4fda57fb07&end=3a5d45f68cadc8fff4fbb557780f92b403b19c19&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.6% on `full` builds of `keccak-debug`)
- A fairly consistent (albeit small) regression in the `typecheck` query across different benchmarks though none of the PRs in the rollup seem to touch that query. This might be noise, but it's hard to tell

#### Improvements

- Move check only relevant in error case out of critical path [#82738](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82738)
- Backport some LLVM compile-time improvements [#82783](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82783)
- Rollup of 10 pull requests [#82953](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82953)
- Update tracing to 0.1.25 [#82553](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82553)

#### Mixed

Upgrade to LLVM 12 [#81451](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81451)

- Very large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=ec7f258d543e1ac7d0b94435972331e85da8c509&end=409920873cf8a95739a55dc5fe5adb05e1b4758e&stat=instructions:u) (up to -11.3% on `full` builds of `keccak-opt`)
- Large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=ec7f258d543e1ac7d0b94435972331e85da8c509&end=409920873cf8a95739a55dc5fe5adb05e1b4758e&stat=instructions:u) (up to 7.7% on `full` builds of `deeply-nested-opt`)
- Some of the perf regression seen here was gained back in [#82783](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82783).

#### Nags requiring follow up

No nags for this week and the nag from last week has been resolved by [#81458](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/81458).

## Nominated Issues

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-compiler)

- "Invalid `field is never read: ` lint warning" [rust#81658](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81658)
  - Already discussed during [`T-lang` meeting](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81658#issuecomment-794334545)
  - Conclusion is to improve diagnostic
  - However, related issue [rust#81626](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81626) _is_ a stable-to-beta regression
  - Should we "just" revert [PR #81473](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/81473) on beta-alone, and in parallel improve the diagnostic on nightly?
- "Make symbols stripping work on MacOS X" [rust#82037](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/82037)
  - MacOS' linker can't strip binaries anymore, [Apple documentation](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/72110#issuecomment-641169818) recommend using a separate `strip` tool for that.
  - This change allows the compiler to use that tool after a target has been compiled to strip symbols.
  - Assigned to @**Esteban Küber** asks more eyeballs on this
- "`undefined reference to` linker error when using dylibs" [rust#82151](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82151)
  - Opened by @**Alex Kornitzer**
  - Unassigned and mentioned [two meetings ago](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/238009-t-compiler.2Fmeetings/topic/.5Bweekly.20meeting.5D.202021-02-25.20.2354818/near/227788998), scheduled to be discussed again today
- "add dynamically-linked musl targets" [rust#82556](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/82556)
  - Mentioned in [PR waiting on team](https://hackmd.io/3dTKNk1_RiK3NOZMfyOldw?view#PRs-S-waiting-on-team)
- "`fn() -> Out` is a valid type for unsized types `Out`, and it implements `FnOnce<(), Output = Out>`" [rust#82633](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82633)
  - opened by @**Frank Steffahn**
  - issue bisection seems to point to PR [#73905](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73905)
  - issue seems to [reproducible on stable since long](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82633#issuecomment-789168223) (so not a regression) but to be unsound on nightly
  - something to investigate a bit closer -> (needs an owner)

[T-libs-impl](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-libs-impl)

- No nominated issues for `T-libs-impl` this time.

[RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-compiler)

- No nominated RFCs for `T-compiler` this time.
