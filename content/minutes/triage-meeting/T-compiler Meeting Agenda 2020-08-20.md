  - Discussed last week
  - Assigned to @**pnkfelix**
  - I-unsound stable regression, started failing when we updated to LLVM 9.0
  - [LLVM issue reproduced on LLVM master](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74498#issuecomment-661950983)
  - Rust started to trigger this misbehavior more frequent since the introduction of [rust#69659](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/69659) that happened in 1.45+.
  - @**pnkfelix** [filled a bug with LLVM upstream](https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=46943)
  - [According to @**pnkfelix**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74498#issuecomment-667452406) the remaining question is if we should, for the short term, change that `range.rs` code to not used an `unchecked_add`, in order to (hopefully) bypass the misoptimization here or patch LLVM.
  - @**pnkfelix** [also discusses](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74498#issuecomment-668598776) if this generates an overflow or not.
- "Unexpected trait resolution overflow error" [rust#74868](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74868)
  - Assigned to @**pnkfelix** and @**Matthew Jasper**

  - Assigned to @**lcnr**

  - Fixed by [rust#75443](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75443), issue still open waiting for backport
    - (was unilaterally accepted for beta backport; see earlier announcement)

[libs-impl](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AP-critical+label%3Alibs-impl)

- No `P-critical` issues for `libs-impl` this time.

  - Discussed last week
  - Cargo lib skeleton + should_panic test code fails on QEMU armv7
  - It seems to be caused by [rust#72746](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72746) by @**tmandry**
  - Seems to be specific to QEMU, [see comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74820#issuecomment-673977399)

[Nightly regressions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aregression-from-stable-to-nightly+P-high+no%3Aassignee)

  - Discussed last week
  - Regressed on [rust#73643](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73643) which is a rollup, likely to be [rust#72493](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72493)

## Performance logs

This week was quite noisy, with many small regressions and improvements.
Overall, instruction counts have increased somewhat, while max RSS remains the
same. There were several updates to core data structures (`HashMap`,
`IndexMap`), which contributed to some of the noise.

Triage done by @ecstaticmorse.

  - LLVM_ENABLE_ZLIB flag enabled in LLVM builds causes undefined symbols
  - @**simulacrum** this is just too many platforms which are broken when enabling zlib.
  - @**simulacrum** is leaning towards disabling zlib entirely until we can provide a workaround.
  - Nominated to discuss a possible solution to this problem.
  - Haiku is Tier 3 but issue shows up also on NetBSD and aarch64-apple-darwin
  - There are some proposed solutions [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75655#issuecomment-675424522) and [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75655#issuecomment-675475933) and [the one proposed by @**mati865** is reported to work](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75655#issuecomment-677090444)

[libs-impl](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-nominated+label%3Alibs-impl)

- No nominated issues for `libs-impl` this time.
