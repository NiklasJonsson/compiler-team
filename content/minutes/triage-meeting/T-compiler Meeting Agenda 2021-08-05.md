### WG checkins

@_WG-mir-opt_ by @**oli**:

> [wg-mir-opt is out of review capacity](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/189540-t-compiler.2Fwg-mir-opt/topic/wg-mir-opt.20is.20out.20of.20review.20capacity). We have several open PRs but no one to review them. We could move to a more permissive model where we add new mir opts that are too large to review properly (at present) into the unsound mir opt list (or at least mir opt level 4). This way they don't bitrot and people can try them, but quality suffers.

@wg-polymorphization by @**davidtwco**:

> There's no update from the polymorphization working group. Everyone involved is working on other things.
>
> @\_**davidtwco** is starting a new job in September where he'll be working on rustc and should be able to contribute more soon!

## Backport nominations

[T-compiler stable](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Abeta-nominated+-label%3Abeta-accepted+label%3AT-compiler) / [T-compiler beta](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Astable-nominated+-label%3Astable-accepted+label%3AT-compiler)

- unilateral beta backport [rust#87483](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87483) "Mir borrowck does not generate lifetime variables for 'static lifetimes during opaque type resolution"

- :beta: "Always preserve sub-obligations in the projection cache" [rust#85868](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/85868)
  - [discussed last week](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/238009-t-compiler.2Fmeetings/topic/.5Bweekly.5D.202021-07-29.20.2354818/near/247588561)
  - @**Wesley Wiser** [comments](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/238009-t-compiler.2Fmeetings/topic/.5Bweekly.5D.202021-07-29.20.2354818/near/247588679) this should reviewed & merged on nightly before we talk about beta backports
  - @**pnkfelix** [comments](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/238009-t-compiler.2Fmeetings/topic/.5Bweekly.5D.202021-07-29.20.2354818/near/247588695): also premature to discuss beta backporting so let's keep it nominated as a reminder
- :beta: "Update compiler_builtins to fix i128 shift/mul on thumbv6m" [rust#87633](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87633)
  - opened by @**Amanieu**
  - nominated by @**simulacrum**, patch seems harmless (see [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87633#issuecomment-890556479))
  - fixes [rust#86063](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86063), a bug in LLVM expansion of 128-bit shifts (see [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86063#issuecomment-886555639))
  - slipped into stable but we can still backport to beta

[T-rustdoc stable](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Abeta-nominated+-label%3Abeta-accepted+label%3AT-rustdoc) / [T-rustdoc beta](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Astable-nominated+-label%3Astable-accepted+label%3AT-rustdoc)

- No backport nominations for `T-rustdoc` this time.

- "Wrap libraries in linker groups, allowing backwards/circular references" [rust#85805](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/85805)
  - discussed last week

  - @**Vadim Petrochenkov** [mentioned to postpone for a few months](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/85805#issuecomment-868825690)
  - @**pnkfelix** suggested to draft a MCP to boost signal for this PR
- "Ignore comments in tidy-filelength" [rust#87462](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87462)
  - Opened by @**Ibraheem Ahmed**
  - PR goal seems to be to avoid nagging on long files if the length is primarily due to comment lines
  - @**simulacrum** [suggests](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87462#issuecomment-890577887) an MCP could be a better fit

## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2021-08-03](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-08-03.md)

Quiet week for performance, with no large changes. Regressions are limited to
just a few benchmarks.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [998cfe5aad7c21eb19a4bca50f05a13354706970..3354a44d2fa8d5ba6b8d6b40d2596de2c8292ec1](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=998cfe5aad7c21eb19a4bca50f05a13354706970&end=3354a44d2fa8d5ba6b8d6b40d2596de2c8292ec1&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

2 Regressions, 0 Improvements, 0 Mixed; 1 of them in rollups

#### Regressions

Rollup of 9 pull requests [#87640](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87640)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=ef9549b6c0efb7525c9b012148689c8d070f9bc0&end=1f0a591b3a5963a0ab11a35dc525ad9d46f612e4&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.4% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `html5ever-check`)
- Regressions across a few benchmarks, without an obvious cause. May be due to
  [#87385](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87385), but logs don't appear
  to show the warning in those crates at a cursory check. Tagged with
  perf-regression for further investigation.

Implement advance_by, advance_back_by for slice::{Iter, IterMut} [#87387](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87387)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=b289bb7fdfcb6f54d825927ab9b5722cabc2a140&end=6b0b07d41f07e1ba5808693d900903499ccf7a32&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.6% on `full` builds of `regex-opt`)
- Unclear cause, likely LLVM-related.
