## Issues of Note

### Short Summary

- [1 P-critical issues](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AT-compiler+label%3AP-critical+) (same as last week)
- [43 P-high issues](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AT-compiler+label%3AP-high+) (2 less than last week)
  - [22 of those are unassigned](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AT-compiler+label%3AP-high+no%3Aassignee) (4 less than last week)
- [1 P-high, 2 P-medium, 1 P-low, 2 T-libs and 1 T-rustdoc regression-from-stable-to-beta](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/regression-from-stable-to-beta)
  - The only assigned is the P-high one. One of the T-libs and the T-rustdoc are unassigned.
- [3 P-high, 3 P-medium, 1 P-low and 1 T-libs regression-from-stable-to-nightly](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/regression-from-stable-to-nightly)
  - Only 2 P-high are assigned.
- [69 regression-from-stable-to-stable](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/regression-from-stable-to-stable)
  - [24 of those are not prioritized](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aregression-from-stable-to-stable+-label%3AP-critical+-label%3AP-high+-label%3AP-medium+-label%3AP-low).

### P-critical

- "`static FOO:Foo=FOO;` doesn't cause cycle error for zero-sized-type with no public constructor." [#71078](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71078)
  - This issue is assigned to @oli
  - This is `P-critical` but is not going to be included in 1.43.0. `P-critical` means that it potentially blocks the release and this time it didn't block it.
  - Should this one be beta-nominated after the nightly to beta promotion happens? (If PR #71078 lands before promotion then point is moot.)

### Unassigned P-high regressions

- "`broken MIR` `NoSolution` sized array initialiser with addition in generic tuple destructure" [#71344](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/71344)

## Nominated Issues

[T-compiler I-nominated](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-compiler)

- "`unsized_locals` fails to uphold alignment requirements" [#71416](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/71416)
  - We need to discuss about a possible solution for this one.
- "Debuginfo tests are not running" [#47163](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/47163)
  - According to @jonas-schievink, we have not been able to run these tests for over 2 years. There are some PRs by @tromey. It's not clear if [#71428](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71428) fixes this problem entirely or partially.
- "Rename mir::Rvalue to Op." [#70928](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70928)
  - We discussed this one last week. It would be good to mention that the discussion keeps going and Zulip may be a good place for it.
