### WG checkins

- @_WG-async-foundations_ by @**nikomatsakis** @**tmandry** ([previous checkin](https://hackmd.io/9aTxrdTQSaS_Fx55dEW1hA))
  Checkin text by pnkfelix, taken from https://rust-lang.github.io/async-fundamentals-initiative/updates/2021-oct.html

> Our overall charter: Make it possible to write async fn in traits, as well as enabling key language features that bring async more into parity with sync:
>
> - Async functions in traits
>   \*in both static and dyn contexts
> - Async drop
>   Async closures

> We have identified an MVP, which aims to support async fn in traits in static contexts by desugaring to an (anonymous) associated GAT plus (on the impl side) a TAIT. We are preparing an RFC describing this MVP and talking to various folks about doing the implementation work.

- @_WG-traits_ by @**nikomatsakis** @**Jack Huey** ([previous checkin](https://hackmd.io/9aTxrdTQSaS_Fx55dEW1hA))
  > In general, work continues on GATs, TAITs, dyn upcasting, and followup for normalization under binders and incremental projection cache PRs.
  >
  > - For GATs, a few blockers remain for stabilization, [found here](https://rust-lang.github.io/generic-associated-types-initiative/updates/2021-oct.html). Feedback/thoughts request on the [placement of where clauses](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89122).
  > - Oli-obk continues to work on refactoring the inference for TAITs. Some diagnostic PRs have been opened that need review.
  > - Dyn upcasting recently had a [question](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144729-wg-traits/topic/Dyn.20upcasting.20vs.20deref.20coercion) come up regarding Deref impls on dyn types; specfically, these impls mimic upcasting. The current plan is to emit a future compat lint and just accept the breakage - which really just ends up without the deref impl being called.
  > - There has been a bit a followup to do after [#85499](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/85499) landed. In particular, more eagerly normalizing opaque types resulted in a severe perf regression; this has been reverted with the only current fallout being related to TAITs. Some other issues popped up that show that there is still code that won't compile even though it should - but compiliation does get further (not emitting an ICE). Most of the remaining issues are probably blocked on lazy norm.
  > - Finally, some of the changes Aaron Hill made to the way projection caching works to fix incremental bugs seems to have a [perf regression](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89195). Not clear what a correct fix would look like yet.

## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2021-10-05](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-10-05.md)

A fairly busy week, with a relatively high percentage of PRs landing with regressions and improvements. The overall trajectory is fairly neutral for this week though.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**. Revision range: [83f147b3baf21acfc367a6da1045d212cd3957e4..25ec8273855fde2d72ae877b397e054de5300e10](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=83f147b3baf21acfc367a6da1045d212cd3957e4&end=25ec8273855fde2d72ae877b397e054de5300e10&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

5 Regressions, 5 Improvements, 5 Mixed; 1 of them in rollups, 43 comparisons made in total

#### Regressions

Don't anonymize bound region names during typeck [#89250](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89250)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=30acf6def32a340b4bfce6e1e2638f1b05ac2cd9&end=69c1c6a173dcae20c245348f6c7d19074b6109b7&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.6% on `full` builds of `coercions`)
- Regression seems to be real, though no regressions in cycle counts are
  reported, so this is likely an acceptable hit.

Constify ?-operator for Result and Option [#86853](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86853)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=69c1c6a173dcae20c245348f6c7d19074b6109b7&end=c6007fdc7059c677a6c089e8d2915b264c0d1326&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.5% on `incr-full` builds of `stm32f4`)
- This is a small regression on the stm32f4 crate, due to a number of extra
  obligations that are created, presumably due to the checks for whether ?
  operators in this crate can be const. It is likely an acceptable change for
  the time being, particularly as the const-impls functionality is still in
  nascent stages and optimizations may come down the line.
- The PR ended up temporarily reverted by
  [#89450](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89450), though not due to
  performance reasons.

Fix read_to_end to not grow an exact size buffer [#89165](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89165)

- Small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=e737694a4d66b01308b73d4559a35b43e414faf9&end=d25de31a0eeb14ab0c8c4613496fe2d3d9a085dd&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.7% on `full` builds of `piston-image`)
- This regression is unclear in cause, and investigation on the PR did not lead
  to a conclusion. However, the regression is fairly small and the change is
  expected to have impacts on more I/O heavy benchmarks than rustc is.
  Syscall counts were shown to improve on the PR, including for rustc, so the
  optimization seems to work in general.

Fix unsound optimization with explicit variant discriminants [#89489](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89489)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=44593aeb1387b1be355aeaf0040d5927bd80f060&end=a4797664ba9c7d71e586122853858eeb6c153bb9&stat=instructions:u) (up to 2.3% on `full` builds of `style-servo`)
- This is an expected regression, but is clearly justified by the fix for an
  unsound optimization. We expect to reland it with appropriate changes in the
  future.

Fix clippy lints [#89405](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89405)

- Small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=a8387aef8c378a771686878062e544af4d5e2245&end=b27661eb33c74cb514dba059b47d86b6582ac1c2&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.4% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `helloworld`)
- Likely to be painful to investigate -- changes are widely scattered across the
  codebase and in theory "no-ops".

#### Improvements

Note: improvements reports are trimmed down for brevity, but this week `rustc-perf` reports large improvements, therefore: :tada:

- Restructure std::rt [#89011](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89011)
- Remove visible path calculation from allowed deprecation lint [#89395](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89395)
- Avoid nondeterminism in trimmed_def_paths [#89408](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89408)
- Rollup of 14 pull requests [#89512](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89512)
- Deriving: Include bound generic params in type parameters for where clause [#89341](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89341)

#### Mixed

Add more tracing instrumentation [#89048](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89048)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=1d71ba862309d59df710078a845c8772ffb22aba&end=8f8092cc32ec171becef8ceacec7dbb06c5d7d7e&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.6% on `full` builds of `keccak`)
- Very large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=1d71ba862309d59df710078a845c8772ffb22aba&end=8f8092cc32ec171becef8ceacec7dbb06c5d7d7e&stat=instructions:u) (up to 12.0% on `full` builds of `ctfe-stress-4`)
- Regression is mitigated by
  [#89363](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89363), which just barely
  missed being included in this report.

Add an intermediate representation to exhaustiveness checking [#88950](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88950)

- Large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=8f8092cc32ec171becef8ceacec7dbb06c5d7d7e&end=6df1d82869d06b88ff413e63a1e8efbb311e3b5c&stat=instructions:u) (up to -2.6% on `full` builds of `unicode_normalization`)
- Large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=8f8092cc32ec171becef8ceacec7dbb06c5d7d7e&end=6df1d82869d06b88ff413e63a1e8efbb311e3b5c&stat=instructions:u) (up to 2.9% on `full` builds of `match-stress-enum`)
- Code quality improvements mitigate the regressions, which are largely limited
  to a stress test.

Rollup of 6 pull requests [#89435](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89435)

- Small improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=ed937594d3912ced11f6f35a90bb8bf591909d2a&end=b6057bf7b7ee7c58e6a39ead02eaa13b75f908c2&stat=instructions:u) (up to -0.3% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `helloworld`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=ed937594d3912ced11f6f35a90bb8bf591909d2a&end=b6057bf7b7ee7c58e6a39ead02eaa13b75f908c2&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.8% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `externs`)
- Unclear cause for the regression. Hasn't been investigated yet.

Rework HIR API to make invocations of the hir_crate query harder. [#88880](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88880)

- Small improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=b6057bf7b7ee7c58e6a39ead02eaa13b75f908c2&end=c02371c442f811878ab3a0f5a813402b6dfd45d2&stat=instructions:u) (up to -0.4% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `helloworld`)
- Small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=b6057bf7b7ee7c58e6a39ead02eaa13b75f908c2&end=c02371c442f811878ab3a0f5a813402b6dfd45d2&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.2% on `full` builds of `many-assoc-items`)
- Regressions are smaller than improvements. Original perf run didn't return
  regressions at all. Tagged for investigation.

resolve: Cache module loading for all foreign modules [#89239](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89239)

- Small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=edebf77e0090195bf80c0d8cda821e1bf9d03053&end=d14731cb3ced8318d7fc83cbe838f0e7f2fb3b40&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.8% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `tokio-webpush-simple`)
- From the PR: This corrects behaviour for macros 2.0 and avoids an ICE, so a
  0.8% regression seems acceptable.
