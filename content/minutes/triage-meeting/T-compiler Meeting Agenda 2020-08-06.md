### WG checkins

@_WG-prioritization_ checkin by @**spastorino**:

> - We have now a [repo for the working group](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team-prioritization/) and we are mainly handling our todo list as issues there.
> - Our procedure automation cli is "complete" and outputs the agenda but we still need to integrate it with the Zulip bot.
> - We've [documented our procedure](https://forge.rust-lang.org/compiler/prioritization/procedure.html) with a lot of details on Rust Forge.
> - We have added Pre-FCP and FCP information to the announcements.
> - There's a list of things we need to tweak [in our issue tracker](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team-prioritization/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue), help is appreciated :)

@_WG-rfc-2229_ checkin by @**Aman Arora** and @**nikomatsakis**:

> Work is currently on a temporary hiatus because of exam period.
>
> We have been working on various refactorings to allow captures
> to capture not just individual variables but arbitrary places.
>
> Some of the refactorings we are working on:
>
> - Making it so that we don't assume that we always know how many
>   captured variables there are for a particular closure, since
>   that will now need to be inferred by upvar analysis.
> - Extending the [**HIR** definition of a
>   place](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/hir/place/struct.Place.html)
>   to have more information. (rust-lang/project-rfc-2229#10)
> - Created a data structure that captures the full places that a closure uses
>   and then uses that to create the existing capture data structures of
>   individual variables, thus testing out the new visitor and place information. (rust-lang/project-rfc-2229#7)
> - Experimenting with the algorithm to capture minimal places (rust-lang/project-rfc-2229#9)

## PR's S-waiting-on-team

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AS-waiting-on-team+label%3AT-compiler)

- "[android] Add support for android's file descriptor ownership tagging to libstd." [rust#74860](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74860)
  - @**nikomatsakis** is inclined to land the PR but thinks it needs an FCP given it's a user-facing change.
  - This is also of interest of `T-libs` but it lies somewhere on the boundary of "implementation detail" and "public facing API change", so maybe everyone wants weigh in.

[libs-impl](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AS-waiting-on-team+label%3Alibs-impl)

- No PRs waiting on libs-impl this time.

### P-critical

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3AP-critical+label%3AT-compiler)

- "LTO triggers apparent miscompilation on Windows 10 x64" [rust#74498](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74498)
  - Discussed last week
  - Assigned to @**pnkfelix**
  - I-unsound regression from stable to stable, started failing when we updated to LLVM 9.0
  - [LLVM issue reproduced on LLVM master](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74498#issuecomment-661950983)
  - Rust started to trigger this misbehavior more frequent since the introduction of [rust#69659](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/69659) that happened in 1.45+.
  - @**pnkfelix** [filled a bug with LLVM upstream](https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=46943)
  - [According to @**pnkfelix**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74498#issuecomment-667452406) the remaining question is if we should, for the short term, change that `range.rs` code to not used an `unchecked_add`, in order to (hopefully) bypass the misoptimization here or patch LLVM.
  - @**pnkfelix** [also discusses](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74498#issuecomment-668598776) if this generates an overflow or not.
- "Unexpected trait resolution overflow error" [rust#74868](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74868)
  - Assigned to @**pnkfelix**
  - Needs MCVE and bisection
  - Possible culprits [rust#73357](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73357) or [rust#73261](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73261) maybe?
  - According to @**Matthew Jasper** this is probably due to [rust#73452](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73452), [rust#73905](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73905) fixes that issue but is not suitable for a backport. @**Matthew Jasper** is going to provide a PR suitable for a backport.
- "Lifetime error when indexing with borrowed index in beta but not in stable" [rust#74933](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74933)
  - Assigned to @**Gary Guo**
  - Code that compiles on stable, fails on beta
  - Regressed in [rust#73504](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73504) which is a roll-up, likely [rust#72280](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72280)
  - PR by @**Gary Guo** and assigned to @**nikomatsakis** is up in [rust#74960](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74960)

8 regressions, 2 improvements, 1 of them on rollups.
1 outstanding nag from last week.

Regressions

- [convert higher ranked `Predicate`s to `PredicateKind::ForAll` #73503](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73503)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=efc02b03d18b0cbaa55b1e421d792f70a39230b2&end=76e83339bb619aba206e5590b1e4b813a154b199&stat=instructions%3Au))
  Up to 2.5% losses on stress tests, 1-2% on some other real-world crates. This was [expected](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73503#issuecomment-661053865).
- [mv std libs to library/ #73265](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73265#issuecomment-668254522)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=9be8ffcb0206fc1558069a7b4766090df7877659&end=ac48e62db85e6db4bbe026490381ab205f4a614d&stat=instructions%3Au))
  Up to 3% losses on tiny crates, and stress tests show 1-3% regressions.
- [Update cargo #74923](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74923#issuecomment-668261346)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=efc02b03d18b0cbaa55b1e421d792f70a39230b2&end=76e83339bb619aba206e5590b1e4b813a154b199&stat=instructions%3Au))
  This was up to a 28% loss on some incremental benchmarks, as a result of regressions in proc macro performance (expansion is slower).
- [Replace all uses of `log::log_enabled` with `Debug` printers #74876](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74876#issuecomment-668262178)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=6e50a225fd67576e43bab1d4dfa3c97f310786a8&end=1799d31847294d6e3816c17679247a5c206e809a&stat=instructions%3Au))
  A 1.5% regression on the ctfe stress test.
- [std: Switch from libbacktrace to gimli (take 2) #74682](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74682#issuecomment-668264270)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=cfc572cae2d1fc381cce476b5c787fd7221af98c&end=c058a8b8dc5dea0ed9b33e14da9e317e2749fcd7&stat=instructions%3Au))
  An expected loss of up to 20% on smaller benchmarks. This was also a [max-rss](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=cfc572cae2d1fc381cce476b5c787fd7221af98c&end=c058a8b8dc5dea0ed9b33e14da9e317e2749fcd7&stat=max-rss)
  regression, though how big is difficult to determine as this statistics is noisy. See discussion on [Zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/247081-t-compiler.2Fperformance/topic/gimli.20regressions).
  Optimistically, there is a follow-up PR, "metadata: track the simplified Self type for every trait impl #75008", which may [eliminate](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75008#issuecomment-667577993) a good portion of these losses.
- [Normalize all opaque types when converting ParamEnv to Reveal::All #65989](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/65989#issuecomment-668267468)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=62f9aa94c0d0312544589bed78679d85646d4e62&end=6e87bacd37539b7e7cd75152dffd225047fa983a&stat=instructions%3Au))
  A slight performance regression, of up to 4%. Expected.
- [Move 'probably equal' methods to librustc_parse #75004](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75004#issuecomment-668271907)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=8141873e6d50a0a0829fd756b0a16a92b27cfe22&end=46cf80dc1a75ad27f67e79f73fec371a16762494&stat=instructions%3Au))
  A 1% regression on some smaller crates, rustdoc-only.
- [Rollup of 10 pull requests #75060](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=e8876ae2c11f341565059b900eeae1254a9accf1&end=a99ae95c722d4dc8d1eef09aaa4e72d50d496e75&stat=instructions%3Au)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=e8876ae2c11f341565059b900eeae1254a9accf1&end=a99ae95c722d4dc8d1eef09aaa4e72d50d496e75&stat=instructions%3Au))
  Up to 1% regression; unclear cause -- possibly `BTreeMap` changes.

Improvements

- [Cache non-exhaustive separately from attributes #74887](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74887#issuecomment-668258043)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=517385b31b0add8487ff3cc27e216cf3f867ab44&end=10c375700ce170fc57cb617754dc6d0631d3d573&stat=instructions%3Au))
  Up to 2% wins on tiny crates. This arose as an attempt to mitigate some of the effects of [re-landing gimli](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74682).
- [Move from `log` to `tracing` #74726](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74726#issuecomment-668269871)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=de10abf50c514ca648eb3bdcbc912d46b7eb32a6&end=05762e3d6f5facafdd47efdf4203021fadf61bb1&stat=instructions%3Au))
  Up to 1.5% wins, scattered across the smaller benchmarks. Expected.

Nags:

- [Disable polymorphisation #74633](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74633#issuecomment-668243225)
  From last week, this was a performance neutral PR even though the landing of polymorphisation was a regression. Investigation on why needs to be conducted.
