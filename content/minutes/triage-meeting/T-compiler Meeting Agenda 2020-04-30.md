## WG checkins

WG-Polymorphization by @davidtwco:

> I can't remember where the polymorphisation work was last time I gave an update at the meeting, so to remind everyone, the polymorphisation working group is for tracking my master's project - implementing an analysis that will detect when generic parameters are unused, and then reducing monomorphisation as a result.
>
> #69749 has a working implementation of polymorphisation (I've paused working on it until my exams are over), which we've run perf on and gotten mixed results - there are some interesting interactions with LTO on one benchmark configuration, and some cases see 3-5% improvements, but some are worse-off (normally by 1-2%). There's probably some room for improvement yet.

WG-prioritization by @spastorino:

This is the first checkin from WG Prioritization.

- [The group is formally formed](https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/prioritization/)
  - Main goal is to triaging bugs, mainly deciding if bugs are critical (potential release blockers) or not.
  - Route bugs to folks who can fix them.
  - Build the agenda for these meetings.
  - Among other things :)
- We have [some plans](https://hackmd.io/P3yvagSSS7yAI2QxhLfPtQ?view) and [procedures](https://hackmd.io/pHb6eTZ2Sjy6XZmwXZHIBA?view) documented.
- We've created I-prioritize and splitted the meaning of it with I-nominated for easier request for prioritization.
- We've created P-critical and defined the [different priority levels](https://hackmd.io/7NRRbq62TnaezW7-n15cDw) this is still WIP.
- We're trying to have all this process async
  - When someone tags `I-prioritize` a Zulip topic is automatically created requesting for prioritization of the issue in question so we can prioritize async.
  - @rustbot prioritize works too for non-members
  - We should do the same for beta/stable backports, I-nominated, S-waiting-on-team
  - We're also trying to automate with commands our meetings and this one in particular.
