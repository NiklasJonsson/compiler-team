### WG checkins

@_WG-rfc-2229_ by @**Aman Arora**

> We have mostly been working mostly just been on bug fixes as more people try 2021 edition

@_WG-rls2.0_ by @**matklad** ([latest report](https://hackmd.io/zhv96UdPQI-HI9BlW0XuTw))

Steering issue covered by this checkin:

- https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/9580

This has been mostly reactive sprint. I don't think we did anything super "big" this time, but we shipped a lot new features, fixed a bunch of bad bugs, and did some observability improvements (eg, we now know that roughly 2/3 of code is source code, and 1/3 is macro-generated code).

One interesting big thing is that we realized that we've used a wrong model for macro expansion this whole time: https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/9403

## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2021-08-11](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-08-11.md)

A quiet week for performance. Changes, both positive and negative, tended to be isolated to few benchmarks.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [3354a44d2fa8d5ba6b8d6b40d2596de2c8292ec1..6b20506d17f4e5e5bf5bcad7e94add4d754b0ae3](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=3354a44d2fa8d5ba6b8d6b40d2596de2c8292ec1&end=6b20506d17f4e5e5bf5bcad7e94add4d754b0ae3&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

2 Regressions, 1 Improvements, 0 Mixed; 0 of them in rollups

#### Regressions

Use zeroed allocations in the mir interpreter instead eagerly touching the memory [#87777](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87777)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=1f94abcda6884893d4723304102089198caa0839&end=4c29cc8fd09889880880cb6081174c79744ab1b6&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.7% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `ctfe-stress-4-check`)
- The motivation for this PR was to reduce the number of page faults, for the same family of ctfe-stress-4 benchmarks.
- So, perf runs were done on the PR itself, to illustrate the motivated change.
- The number of page faults [did decrease (by up to 25%)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=1f94abcda6884893d4723304102089198caa0839&end=4c29cc8fd09889880880cb6081174c79744ab1b6&stat=faults).
- The regression with respect to instruction counts appears isolated to just the ctfe-stress-4 family; the page fault reduction outweighs instruction count hit.
- (Unfortunately the page fault decrease did not yield a corresponding improvement to reported wall-clock or task-clock times.)

Hide allocator details from TryReserveError [#87408](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87408)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=db3cb435c1197ef3e3919c03b7f81ca8bffbd007&end=996ff2e0a0f911f52bb1de6bdd0cfd5704de1fc9&stat=instructions:u) (up to 4.2% on `full` builds of `html5ever-opt`)
- The regression with respect to instruction counts appears isolated to just the html5ever-opt benchmark; all other reported changes pale in significance.
- Potentially significant: the max-rss for html5ever-opt also regressed here, by 8%.
- (Skimming over the PR itself, I do not see any obvious reason for this significant of a regression to max-rss.)
- Some other benchmarks also regressed with respect to max-rss, but none so significantly.
- Left a [comment on the PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87408#issuecomment-896924754) as a heads up.
