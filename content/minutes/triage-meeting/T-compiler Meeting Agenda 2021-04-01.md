### WG checkins

@_WG-mir-opt_ checkin by @**oli**:

> - Partook in the shrinkmem sprint
> - mir-opt-level=2 is now automatically activated in release mode
> - shaved off a few percentages of max-rss by adjusting MIR datastructures
> - ran some experiments to pinpoint an MVP for MIR inlining

@_WG-polonius_ checkin by @**lqd**

> Nothing especially newsworthy since the last check-in, only a little progress has been made since then.

[P-high beta regressions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aregression-from-stable-to-beta+label%3AP-high)

- "WASI: path_open regression in Rust 1.51 when using LTO" [rust#82758](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82758)
  - fixed by @**simulacrum** in PR [#82804](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/82804), PR should be in 1.51 stable
  - is there an actionable for this issue?
- "`probe-stack=inline-asm` generates wrong DWARF information" [rust#83139](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83139)

  - from the PR comment: after we resolve [#83139](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83139) (potentially by backporting a fix to LLVM or by deciding that one cannot rely on the quality of our DWARF output in the manner described in #83139), we can change this back

- No unassigned `P-high` nightly regressions this time.

## Performance logs

> [2021-04-01 Triage Log](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/7af0553b65a918cf4b19fa289a85bd97abf3f43b/triage/2021-04-01.md)

A somewhat negative weak for performance where regressions outweigh improvements. Sadly, a lot of the regressions don't seem very straight-forward to understand, and so more investigation will be necessary.

Triage done by **@rylev**: 2 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 3 Mixed, 2 of them in rollups

#### Regressions

implement `feature(const_generics_defaults)` [#75384](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75384)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=db492ecd5ba6bd82205612cebb9034710653f0c2&end=5b33de3340c7b36646af46303a30f7066b4bd7db&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.1% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `ucd-check`)
- A small regression in incremental compilation in one particular benchmark `ucd`. The query affected is `generate_crate_metadata` which tracks with the fact that incremental compilation is affected.
- A quick scan of the changes doesn't reveal anything suspicious as encoding of metadata has changed only a little bit and should only be impacted when encoding something with default const generics.

Use `EvaluatedToOkModuloRegions` whenever we erase regions [#83220](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83220)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=f5fe425c925ef36d5f4c18cfa44173fc42de31b8&end=07e0e2ec268c140e607e1ac7f49f145612d0f597&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.8% on `full` builds of `hyper-2-check`)
- A moderate regression in trait obligation evaluation which this code directly impacts.
- A performance run was performed, but the impact was deemed acceptable. The author and reviewer [were pinged](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83220#issuecomment-811752366) about why the performance is acceptable.

Refactor `Binder` to track bound vars [#76814](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76814)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=a5029ac0ab372aec515db2e718da6d7787f3d122&end=4fdac23f3171e2f8864d359a21da600dd3faafc9&stat=instructions:u) (up to 3.9% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `externs-check`)
- Moderate regression in trait resolution queries which this code directly impacts. While a performance run was made, it was never discussed in the PR. The author and reviewer [were pinged](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76814#issuecomment-811758311).

#### Improvements

- Rollup of 9 pull requests [#83432](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83432)
- Rollup of 8 pull requests [#83580](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83580)

#### Mixed

- Remove assignments to ZST places instead of marking ZST return place as unused [#83177](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83177)
- Import small cold functions [#82980](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82980)
- Reduce the impact of Vec::reserve calls that do not cause any allocation [#83357](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83357)

#### Nags requiring follow up
