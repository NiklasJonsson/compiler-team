### WG checkins

@_WG-rfc-2229_ by @**nikomatsakis** @**Matthew Jasper**:

- Overall improvement to closure diagnostics: we now point to part of the source code responsible for the capture kind associated with the error message.

  - Some screenshots of diagnostics here:https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/50

- We can now detect if the closure after enabling RFC 2229 will not meet Clone or any of the auto trait bounds and can provide migrations for it. These migrations are supported via rustfix as well.

- We can annote drop implementations with `#[rustc_insignificant_dtor]` to avoid migrating in scenarios where drop order doesn't affect semantics of the program. We intend to use this attribute to annotate the stdlib to mark certain type as safe to be Drop reorded. eg: when a string gets dropped it would not affect the behavior of rest of the program.

- We wrote an initial implementation for printing out the closure size before and after the feature. The implementation is somewhat incomplete, but was good enough for us to get some data on cargo and stdlib.
  Cargo and all depensices size data: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Irsj5O7HPPfomWat2jPTPdx_KPlsyYo5kRuQpNNuwsQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Irsj5O7HPPfomWat2jPTPdx_KPlsyYo5kRuQpNNuwsQ/edit?usp=sharing)

## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2021-05-18](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-05-18.md)

A lot of noise in the benchmark results this week. We are discussing ([zulip archive](https://zulip-archive.rust-lang.org/247081tcompilerperformance/06104coercionsdebugnoise.html), [live zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/247081-t-compiler.2Fperformance/topic/coercions-debug.20noise)) how best to update the benchmark set to eliminate the noisy cases that are bouncing around. Beyond that, some large improvements to a few individual benchmarks.

The memory usage ([max-rss](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=2021-05-11&end=2021-05-18&absolute=true&stat=max-rss)) seemed largely flat. Except for an upward trend on `tuple-stess` that indicates 4% more memory from a week ago.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.

5 Regressions, 7 Improvements, 2 Mixed
1 of them in rollups

#### Regressions

Reachable statics have reachable initializers [#84549](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/84549)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=747a5d2a5d6693f5e9426524b0dab34eb1587377&end=f8e1e9238077a829ce1ac0cc1f2c7e0eaa4e679d&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.4% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `ctfe-stress-4-opt`)
- `ctfe-stress-4-debug` also saw a 1.2% regression in its `incr-unchanged` builds.
- Other benchmarks were not significantly impacted.
- The two regressions were [anticipated](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/84549#issuecomment-832760519) from a perf run on the PR itself.

#### Improvements (summary)

- have on_completion record subcycles [#85186](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85186)
- Store VariantIdx to distinguish enum variants [#85195](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85195)
- Do not allocate or unwind after fork [#81858](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81858)

#### Mixed

BTree: no longer copy keys and values before dropping them [#84904](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/84904)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=ba8d7e2cb7cfc87070585c17cd0aa4ae7f091a08&end=5c029265465301fe9cb3960ce2a5da6c99b8dcf2&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.2% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `ctfe-stress-4-check` and `ctfe-stress-4-opt` and `ctfe-stress-4-debug`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=ba8d7e2cb7cfc87070585c17cd0aa4ae7f091a08&end=5c029265465301fe9cb3960ce2a5da6c99b8dcf2&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.2% on `incr-patched: println` builds of `cargo-opt`)
- These changes were [anticipated](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/84904#issuecomment-837892302) from a perf run on the PR itself.

rustc_codegen_ssa: only create backend `BasicBlock`s as-needed. [#84993](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/84993)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=fe72845f7bb6a77b9e671e6a4f32fe714962cec4&end=a55748ffe94e71f841c7b1d752779b0db138b342&stat=instructions:u) (up to -4.3% on `full` builds of `syn-opt`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=fe72845f7bb6a77b9e671e6a4f32fe714962cec4&end=a55748ffe94e71f841c7b1d752779b0db138b342&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.8% on `full` builds of `deeply-nested-async-check`)
- The improvement to `syn-opt` was [anticipated](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/84993#issuecomment-841687503) from perf runs on the PR itself.
- The regression on `deeply-nested-async-check` was not predicted by that run.

#### Suspicious Noise (summary)

##### coercions

- rustc_driver cleanup [#83610](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83610)
- Add auto traits and clone trait migrations for RFC2229 [#84730](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/84730)
- Provide ExitStatusError [#82973](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82973)
- Fix `--remap-path-prefix` not correctly remapping `rust-src` component paths and unify handling of path mapping with virtualized paths [#83813](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83813)
- Rollup of 5 pull requests [#85231](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85231)
- Rollup of 8 pull requests [#85414](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85414)

##### html5ever

- Add support for const operands and options to global_asm! [#84107](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/84107)
- Update cc crate [#85190](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85190)

#### Nags requiring follow up

- Double-check whether regression to `deeply-nested-async-check` from [#84993](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/84993) is noise or something real.
- Look into the 4% `tuple-stress` regression. The first seems like gradual creep, plus a 3% jump that seems to be associated with [#84571](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/84571), "Parse unnamed fields of struct and union type." (Perhaps its inherent given the nature of that microbenchmark, but some other benchmarks also had their [memory usage impacted](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=44ec846f4ea68ffa6d06e7d68f078bd3cc59d4ec&end=9964284fed181676300aad693449f5b751e35ff2&stat=max-rss).

## Nominated Issues

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-compiler)

- "ICE: unwrap none error in compiler\rustc_mir\src\monomorphize\collector.rs" [rust#85447](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85447)
  - opened by "kocsis1david"
  - ICE on nightly 2021-05-09 on target `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, latest working version was stable 1.51
  - [bisection comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85447#issuecomment-843614853) seems to point to [#81172](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/81172)
  - comment: It seems that this only occurs if the crate-type is `lib`. Even if I remove a `pub`, it can compile successfully.
  - @**Simon Sapin** did [some reduction and investigation](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85447#issuecomment-843879967), asks for a bit more insights from someone more familiar with the compiler internals
- "error: internal compiler error: unexpected panic: Failed to get crate data for crate21" [#85386](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85386)
  - opened by "T0mstone"
  - ICE on stable 1.52.1, beta 1.53.0-beta.2 and nightly 1.54
  - issue only occurs when compiling for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
  - A reduction is provided [in this comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85386#issuecomment-842457820)
  - [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85386#issuecomment-842487936): adding a call to `extern crate proc_macros` makes the issue disappear
  - perhaps related to [#56935](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/56935)?
  - Question: would it be useful to have someone closer to the target `wasm32-unknown-unknown` evaliate this issue? We're not sure of its impact (maybe a P-high?)
