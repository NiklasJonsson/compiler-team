## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2021-03-18](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-03-16.md)

Added two benchmarks over the past week to the perf suite - diesel and stm32f4,
which are intended to add to the level of tracking for rustdoc and, for both, a
focus on compiler trait machinery.

Performance results for this week are mixed, but overall largely positive.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.

3 Regressions, 3 Improvements, 4 Mixed

#### Regressions

Shorten `rustc_middle::ty::mod` [#82964](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82964)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=066f01d81bfbed746f6b6cf27a0426d829e8e832&end=b3ac52646f7591a811fa9bf55995b24fd17ece08&stat=instructions:u) (up to 4.0% on `full` builds of `deeply-nested-check`)
- Largely limited to diesel-doc builds, but a big regression there; left a nag
  to followup. Likely caused by a change to inlining.

Allow calling *const methods on *mut values [#82436](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82436)

- Very large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=4d76b4ca52a65d63ab83d82d6630f1df8ec05a93&end=f42888c15fd370b8bca4c5646ffc3aac3005dca8&stat=instructions:u) (up to 11.3% on `incr-full` builds of `packed-simd-check`)
- Unfortunate and unexpected regression. Left a nag.

Turn `-Z incremental-verify-ich` on by default [#83007](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83007)

- Very large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=56f74c52c1bb627ada01992787116054bf1e66e9&end=e7e1dc158c3de232750b568163f6941a184ee8be&stat=instructions:u) (up to 15.1% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `issue-46449-debug`)
- Expected mitigation, essentially part of a soundness fix (though due to other
  bugs in the compiler - this just adds asserts that catches those).

#### Improvements

- Eagerly construct bodies of THIR [#82495](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82495)
- Iterate on crate_inherent_impls for metadata. [#83082](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83082)
- Tweaks to stable hashing [#83064](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83064)

#### Mixed

- Store HIR attributes in a side table [#79519](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79519)
- Enable MemorySSA in MemCpyOpt [#82806](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82806)
- Don't implement mem::replace with mem::swap. [#83022](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83022)
- Rebase and fixup #80493: Remove MIR assignments to ZST types [#83118](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83118)
