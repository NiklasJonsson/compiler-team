@_WG-llvm_ checkin by @**Nikita Popov** :

> The first parts of the mustprogress attribute have landed (https://reviews.llvm.org/D86233, https://reviews.llvm.org/D85393). This means that forward progress is now opt-in. Once this work is complete, this will resolve current bugs around infinite loops being optimized away. There isn't a patch for that yet, but I dare say the hardest part (convincing people that this is the right thing to do) is done now...
>
> MemorySSA-based DSE has been enabled by default (https://reviews.llvm.org/D87163), which means dead stores are eliminated across based blocks. Expect some compile-time regression... More importantly for rust, I've ported MemCpyOpt to MSSA (https://reviews.llvm.org/D89207), which will allow memcpy's to be eliminated across blocks as well, a long-standing optimization problem. It's not the first attempt to do this, but I'm optimistic :)
>
> Some older changes that I probably have not mentioned before. I've finally managed to make correlated value propagation optimize conditions based on local value ranges (https://reviews.llvm.org/D69686), which will resolve various missing bounds check optimizations where constant operands are involved. There is also a new constraint elimination pass (https://reviews.llvm.org/D84547) which is able to reason about complex implications symbolically. However, it is not enabled by default, and there's no roadmap to enable it at present.
>
> Also been a while ago, but someone took over my work for introducing saturating float to int casts (https://reviews.llvm.org/D54749). There's been some slow progress, and maybe there's a chance that this will land before the heat death of the universe... Rust has worked around this in the meantime, but once/if it lands we can improve codegen.

## Beta-nominations

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Abeta-nominated+-label%3Abeta-accepted+label%3AT-compiler)

- "Tweak `if let` suggestion to be more liberal with suggestion and to not ICE" [rust#77283](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77283)
  - Opened by @**Esteban KÃ¼ber**
  - Should fix [rust#77218](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77218) (`P-high` beta regression) and [rust#77238](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77238)
- "Revert "Allow dynamic linking for iOS/tvOS targets."" [rust#77716](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77716)
  - (has not landed in nightly)
  - Opened by `@francesca64`
  - Assigned to @**Jonas Schievink**
  - This patch reverts [rust#73516](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73516) and **disallows** compiling against dynamic libs (Apple does not allow that and your App won't be published)
  - Previous patch however **allowed** dynamic linking
  - Reverting now the patch breaks code in production (as pointed out by `@aspenluxxxy`, previous patch author)
  - @**Jonas Schievink** [suggests as last resort](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77716#issuecomment-709364682) to revert the previous patch (although not the ideal solution) since this can now be considered a regression from stable
  - `@cutsoy` implements a patch [adding a new parameter to cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77716#issuecomment-709410444)
  - Issue reporter [suggests](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77716#issuecomment-712492125) that the above patch works just fine
  - Question: from the T-compiler point of view, anything else that can be done/investigated or the case is closed?
- "Disable MatchBranchSimplification" [rust#78151](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78151)
  - Opened by `@tmiasko`
  - Mentions that this optimization can result in unsoundness, because it introduces additional uses of a place holding the discriminant value without ensuring that it is valid
  - Patch found after adding the [-Zvalidate-mir](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77369) validation
- "Disable "optimization to avoid load of address" in InstCombine" [rust#78195](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78195)
  - Opened by `@tmiasko`
  - Assigned to @**oli**

  - Reported by @**Daniel Henry-Mantilla|232018**

## Performance logs

A variety of changes, nothing particularly notable from a performance
perspective. [#77792](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77792) is an
interesting win on migrating to tracing values rather than the older log
formatting. [#76859](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76859) is also
interesting, starting out as a functional fix but appears to have been a
performance win for incremental benchmarks in some cases as well.

- Functional change. Regression not significantly major to warrant a revert.

[#78060](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78060)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=ffeeb20398bb9a25c1f75599b942f57c85a2140d&end=043eca7f0b34d12e61c44206beca740628647080&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.2% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `clap-rs-check`)
- Rollup; likely due to BTreeMap or meta-prelude changes. Not worth deep
  investigation: regression is minor and interesting changes are likely not
  readily changeable.

[#77250](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77250)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=19356453cbfb734bc60a1853c10e3095d05e0342&end=22e6b9c68941996daa45786b4145e6196e51f0f4&stat=instructions:u) (up to 3.1% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `packed-simd-check`)
- Functional change that we definitely want, performance regression is not too
  significant.

### Improvements

[#76859](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76859)

- Very large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=06a079c43efb062e335e6e6c9dabd3c750619980&end=c71248b70870960af9993de4f31d3cba9bbce7e8&stat=instructions:u) (up to -58.0% on `incr-patched: Compiler new` builds of `regex-opt`)
- Correctness is the key here, but it seems like our hand-rolled incremental
  tracking was (at least on the perf benchmarks) worse anyway.

[#77792](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77792)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=8dae8cdcc8fa879cea6a4bbbfa5b32e97be4c306&end=abbdec3be6cfce1175d0dc6737a2999cf43b530d&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.7% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `deeply-nested-async-opt`)
- Switching to tracing spans and tracing's "values" over string-formatting seems
  to have been a improvement here. Definitely an interesting result --
  presumably tracing's handling is somehow more visible to LLVM?

[#77796](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77796)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=abbdec3be6cfce1175d0dc6737a2999cf43b530d&end=afb4514c099fde6e3102373602bea9e6dacd4f88&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.4% on `full` builds of `deeply-nested-async-check`)
- Seems like potentially a slight regression on wall times, but ultimately the
  change is good on its merits, so no action is taken at this time.

[#77947](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77947)

- Large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=b6e2dc6cdece6b498b876bc7e9377ff7d63d93e7&end=9bd740a8f17d75168b683bcfb077b6e450047df5&stat=instructions:u) (up to -7.4% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `cranelift-codegen-debug`)
- Seems to be a mixed result on [wall
  times](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=b6e2dc6cdece6b498b876bc7e9377ff7d63d93e7&end=9bd740a8f17d75168b683bcfb077b6e450047df5&stat=wall-time)
  though.

[#77373](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77373)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=6af9846fcc8797bf97e9fb387385208c2219f3d0&end=ffeeb20398bb9a25c1f75599b942f57c85a2140d&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.6% on `full` builds of `deeply-nested-async-check`)
- Wall times are less positive, but mostly on incremental. Not deemed a concern.

[#77908](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77908)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=cb2462c53f2cc3f140c0f1ea0976261cab968a34&end=f90e6173053f7e6b377d7f75367b511ceee7d9d1&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.8% on `full` builds of `inflate-check`)

[#78151](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78151)

- Large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=9832374f6e378971e1a933362cf9781b121bb845&end=981346fc07dd5ef414c5b1b21999f7604cece006&stat=instructions:u) (up to -7.6% on `incr-patched: println` builds of `regression-31157-opt`)
