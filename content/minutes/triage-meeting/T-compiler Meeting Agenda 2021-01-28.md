### P-critical

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AP-critical+label%3AT-compiler)

- No `P-critical` issues for `T-compiler` this time.

[libs-impl](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AP-critical+label%3Alibs-impl)

- "File implementation on Windows has unsound methods" [rust#81357](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81357)
  - an unsoundness on how Rust handles the Windows I/O API, should be probably marked as critical. we don't have a MVCE from a Windows user, but possibly it's been there since long time.
  - [libs meeting report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81357#issuecomment-768607504) by @**Ashley Mannix**: seems the consensus is ack one of the options suggested by the issue reporter (call `GetOverlappedResult` and if it returns error, call `abort()`)

[T-rustdoc](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AP-critical+label%3AT-rustdoc)

- No `P-critical` issues for `T-rustdoc` this time.

  - discussed last week, @**pnkfelix** self-assigned
  - seems to affect specifically s390x or to be related to endianess
  - Issue not yet completely clear, could be checked against PR [#80732](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80732) (not ready for merge yet)

  - @**Matthew Jasper** comments that pr #78373 [caused MIR to have one fewer basic block](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80949#issuecomment-760019484) which reduced borrowck precision

  - Assigned to @**pnkfelix**
  - possibly related to issue [#77713](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77713)
  - @**simulacrum** points to PR [#78864](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78864) and figures out [the root cause](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80988#issuecomment-761622611)
  - discussed in the [T-lang meeting](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80988#issuecomment-763096218), the decision would be to close this
  - @**pnkfelix** [comments](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80988#issuecomment-763874759) that the specific issue discussed in the RFC is probably best dealt in issue [#81218](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81218)

## Performance logs

> [2020-01-26 Triage full logs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-01-26.md)

This week continues a trend of relatively large rollups, which often contain perf-sensitive PRs. We need to get better at marking PRs as rollup=never or otherwise not including them, but it is unclear how precisely to go about doing so. The tooling for testing individual PRs merged in rollups should also be improved to work better in the next few days, though.

Other than that, this week saw several regressions, most of which were not easily explained. We are seeking feedback from PR authors and reviewers on whether the results are expected and if anything can be done.

Triage done by **@rylevick** and **@simulacrum**.

5 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 1 Mixed;
3 of them in rollups

#### Regressions

Deprecate-in-future the constants superceded by RFC 2700 [#80958](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80958)

- Unsure why this might be causing performance regressions as this change does not touch much code and only produces lint warnings when the user opts into them.
- The author of the PR [was asked why this might be the case](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80958#issuecomment-767837811), and a nag noted.
