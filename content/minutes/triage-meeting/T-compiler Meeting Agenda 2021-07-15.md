### WG checkins

@_WG-async-foundations_ by @**nikomatsakis** and @**tmandry** :

> Checkin text

@_WG-traits_ by @**nikomatsakis** and @**Jack Huey**

> We recently (last week) had an organizational meeting and reviewed various initiatives/projects that WG-traits is working on. These include: GATs, TAIT, rustc_type_ir, trait upcasting, salsa, Chalk, and fixing trait-related incremental bugs.
> We decided to no longer have a single weekly meeting, in favor of more targeted "1:1" meetings (as needed for each initiative). We will still be having a steering/organizational meeting once a month. We haven't decided if that'll take the same timeslot as the weekly meeting or change.
> Updates of individual initiatives:
> **GATs**
> We realized that in [#85499] (normalization under binders), we run into problems when we want to project but can't yet (i.e. `<T as Trait>::Foo<'a>`) and the associated type will _eventually_ contain a bound var. So, for now, the plan is to fall back to no normalization when we don't have enough information to project. This still fixes the ICEs in [#62529], but results in some errors where we want to pass. Also split out [#86993] as a more minimal GATs-only change (which can be landed before, or skipped).
> **TAIT**
> We had a meeting and found that the implementation is still a bit wrong. There's a bit more work to do before stabilization of `min_type_alias_impl_trait`, including fixing a number of issues.
> **rustc_type_ir**
> There is an open PR [#86435] to begin moving major types (like `TyKind`) into `rustc_type_ir` and out of `rustc_middle`. Blocked on some lifetime variance (probably) issues that need to be looked into.
> **trait upcasting**
> There is an open PR [#86461] to refactor the vtable format and a bigger PR [#86264] that is being split out into smaller PRs.
> **salsa, Chalk** > [chalk#708] got merged, which reworks the recursive solver to be prepare to use salsa for fixed-point iteration.
> **incremental ICEs trait work**
> There are [3 approaches](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144729-wg-traits/topic/subobligations.20and.20ICEs.20.2385868/near/245066992) open to solve the `evaluate_obligation` incremental issue, but each have a moderate perf impact. They need to be reviewed to pick the best solution.

## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2021-07-13](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-07-13.md)

Mostly quiet week; improvements outweighed regressions.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [9a27044f42ace9eb652781b53f598e25d4e7e918..5aff6dd07a562a2cba3c57fc3460a72acb6bef46](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=9a27044f42ace9eb652781b53f598e25d4e7e918&end=5aff6dd07a562a2cba3c57fc3460a72acb6bef46&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

1 Regressions, 4 Improvements, 0 Mixed; 0 of them in rollups

#### Regressions

Support forwarding caller location through trait object method call [#81360](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81360)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=a84d1b21aea9863f0fc5f436b4982d145dade646&end=3982eb35cabe3a99194d768d34a92347967c3fa2&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.5% on `incr-full` builds of `unused-warnings-check`)
- Largely due to increased number of calls to the newly-made query
  should_inherit_track_caller. Mostly higher regressions on smaller benchmarks.

#### Improvements

- Reland "Merge CrateDisambiguator into StableCrateId" [#86143](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86143)
- Stop generating `alloca`s & `memcmp` for simple short array equality [#85828](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85828)
- Add support for raw-dylib with stdcall, fastcall functions [#86419](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86419)
- Use clang 12.0.1 on dist-x86_64/i686-linux [#87019](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87019)

#### Nags requiring follow up
