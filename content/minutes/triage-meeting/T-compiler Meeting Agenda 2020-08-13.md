### WG checkins

@_WG-rls2.0_ checkin by @**matklad**:

- RFC2912 (move from rls to rust-analyzer)

  - soft-blocked on merging VS Code extensions: https://github.com/rust-lang/vscode-rust/issues/812.
  - rust-analyzer is available via rustup, but update procedure for rust-lang/rust is not smooth: rust-analyzer often fails to build for weird targets.

- Library-ification

  - Started the effort to extract the parser (there's an MCP to form a parser library-ification wg, to improve communication)
  - No big progress yet, mostly looking around at existing code
  - Un-Grammar for concrete syntax trees: https://github.com/rust-analyzer/ungrammar/blob/master/rust.ungram
    - Could we use it to generate rustc's AST? Seems unlikely :(
  - Some glances at name resolution -- it seems like it should be possible to extract a small core of "set of 'module' scopes with names + fixed point iteration",
    but this is low priority for now.

- Org

  - Microsoft will sponsor rust-analyzer a bit via GitHub Sponsors: https://twitter.com/jeffwilcox/status/1293678932433055745

- Misc
  - Perf Dashboard https://rust-analyzer.github.io/metrics/
  - Automatic reload on Cargo.toml changes

@_WG-self-profile_ checkin by @**wesleywiser**:

- @**nagisa** contributed some [improved documentation](https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme/pull/118), [bug fixes and other enhancements](https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme/pull/119).
- @**Mark-Simulacrum** updated perf.rlo to include flamegraphs, Chrome-profiler data and the raw self-profile output on new runs. (See [the new links on the details page](https://perf.rust-lang.org/detailed-query.html?commit=3fbed1739c384faabf00cd8a62abedbf506e949b&base_commit=4a689da944977496fb758cc2d700984cc6a10b7f&benchmark=style-servo-debug&run_name=full))
- @**michaelwoerister** has [a PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75452) up to shrink self-profile string data from detailed rustc invocations by 8-9%.
- @**eddyb** has been working on using hardware counters (`rdpmc` instruction) to capture instruction counts instead of user-space timings. This is still work in progress but you can follow along in [this Zulip thread](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/247081-t-compiler.2Fperformance).

### P-critical

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3AP-critical+label%3AT-compiler)

- "LTO triggers apparent miscompilation on Windows 10 x64" [rust#74498](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74498)
  - Discussed last week
  - Assigned to @**pnkfelix**
  - I-unsound stable regression, started failing when we updated to LLVM 9.0
  - [LLVM issue reproduced on LLVM master](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74498#issuecomment-661950983)
  - Rust started to trigger this misbehavior more frequent since the introduction of [rust#69659](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/69659) that happened in 1.45+.
  - @**pnkfelix** [filled a bug with LLVM upstream](https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=46943)
  - [According to @**pnkfelix**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74498#issuecomment-667452406) the remaining question is if we should, for the short term, change that `range.rs` code to not used an `unchecked_add`, in order to (hopefully) bypass the misoptimization here or patch LLVM.
  - @**pnkfelix** [also discusses](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74498#issuecomment-668598776) if this generates an overflow or not.
- "Unexpected trait resolution overflow error" [rust#74868](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74868)
  - Assigned to @**pnkfelix** and @**Matthew Jasper**
  - Needs MCVE and bisection
  - Possible culprits [rust#73357](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73357) or [rust#73261](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73261) maybe?
  - According to @**Matthew Jasper** this is probably due to [rust#73452](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73452), [rust#73905](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73905) fixes that issue but is not suitable for a backport. @**Matthew Jasper** is going to provide a PR suitable for a backport.
- "Panic when compiling gluon on 1.46" [rust#75313](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75313)
  - It is unassigned
  - It's a beta regression, regressed in [rust#72796](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/72796)
  - @**RalfJ** [provided a PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75419)

[libs-impl](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AP-critical+label%3Alibs-impl)

- No P-critical issues for libs-impl this time.

[T-rustdoc](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AP-critical+label%3AT-rustdoc)

- No P-critical issues for T-rustdoc this time.

[Beta regressions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aregression-from-stable-to-beta+P-high+no%3Aassignee)

- "libtest panics when running `should_panic` tests under QEMU armv7 " [rust#74820](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74820)
  - Cargo lib skeleton + should_panic test code fails on armv7
  - It seems to be caused by [rust#72746](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72746) by @**tmandry**

[Nightly regressions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aregression-from-stable-to-nightly+P-high+no%3Aassignee)

- "Type mismatch in function arguments E0631, E0271 are falsely recognized as E0308 mismatched types" [rust#74400](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74400)
  - Discussed last week
  - Regressed on [rust#73643](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73643) which is a rollup, likely to be [rust#72493](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72493)
