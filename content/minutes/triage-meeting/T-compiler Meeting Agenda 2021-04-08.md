### P-high regressions

[P-high beta regressions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aregression-from-stable-to-beta+label%3AP-high+-label%3AT-infra+-label%3AT-libs+-label%3AT-release+-label%3AT-rustdoc+-label%3AT-core)

  - from the PR comment: after we resolve [#83139](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83139) (potentially by backporting a fix to LLVM or by deciding that one cannot rely on the quality of our DWARF output in the manner described in #83139), we can change this back

## Performance logs

> [2021-04-06 Full triage logs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-04-06.md)

A pretty major week for [memory usage improvements](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=4896450e7e0a522486b4d3a8d360ac4e1d2072a0&end=d32238532138485c80db4f2cd596372bce214e00&absolute=false&stat=max-rss), while wall time performance
largely stayed neutral, with an average of ~20% gains on memory usage for
release builds, and 5% on check builds, due to an update in the default allocator
used (to a more recent jemalloc).

Triage done by **@simulacrum**: 1 Regressions, 4 Improvements, 0 Mixed

#### Regressions

add OR_PATTERNS_BACK_COMPAT lint [#83468](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83468)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=a207871d5c22f89093085da89becbb636a45ef89&end=36bcf4069717b9dff90270d13b53a3b130329960&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.2% on `incr-patched: println` builds of `coercions-debug`)
- Relatively small hit on a number of benchmarks. Likely largely unavoidable.

#### Improvements

- Stream the dep-graph to a file instead of storing it in-memory [#82780](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/82780)
- panic early when `TrustedLen` indicates a `length > usize::MAX` [#83726](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83726)
- Use tikv-jemallocator in rustc/rustdoc in addition to jemalloc-sys when enabled. [#83152](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83152)

#### Nags requiring follow up

- The [issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/82964#issuecomment-800663588) from three weeks ago has stalled.
  Likely this needs someone to mentor the author, or to take over the
  investigation.
