### WG checkins

- @_wg-incr-comp_ checkin by @**pnkfelix** and @**Wesley Wiser**:

  > Most of wg-incr-comp members have been busy with other tasks. We have not had time to revisit any of the A-incr-comp labelled backlog.
  > We have had a lot of positive activity from @_**cjgillot** ([PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Acjgillot)) and @_**mw** ([PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amw)), especially inflight improvements to how we handle disk/memory traffic for the incremental state ([PR #82780](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/82780), [PR #83214](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83214))
  > @\_**Aaron Hill** enabled incremental hash (ICH) validation ([PR #83007](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83007)) which has uncovered many pre-existing bugs that they are now fixing.

- @_WG-llvm_ by @**nagisa**:

> WG-llvm update: We bumped the LLVM version to a commit from a 12-series branch as well as the minimum LLVM version from 9 to 10. There has been a concentrated effort to clean up a number of regressions that we ended up hitting as well as to enable various features (e.g. noalias) that are fixed in LLVM 12.
>
> As there was a recent train roll-over and there are still some outstanding issues surfaced by LLVM12, fixes that we make over the next 6 weeks to the regressions caused by this upgrade should be often be backported.

- Example of note: [Issue #83335](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83335), an AArch64 bare metal miscompile on LLVM12

## Performance logs

> [2021-03-23 Triage Log](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-03-23.md)

An overall busy but decent week for performance. While there were some performance regressions they were mostly small, and they were outnumbered by performance gains. Perhaps the most interesting news is not a compiler performance improvement but rather the introduction of no-alias optimizations at the LLVM level. This slightly hurts optimized build time performance in some cases, but it should make some workloads run faster after compilation.

Triage done by **@rylev**.

2 Regressions, 5 Improvements, 3 Mixed
1 of them in rollups

#### Regressions

Implement (but don't use) valtree and refactor in preparation of use [#82936](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82936)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=f5d8117c338a788bd24abec733fd143dfceb25a0&end=e655fb62216b6ba64a094b30f116d7988d19322d&stat=instructions:u) (up to 2.1% on `full` builds of `ctfe-stress-4-opt`)
- Purely an addition of unused code (for a future feature). It is possible that this changed some inlining behavior, but the benchmark in question is susceptible to high variance though it seemed to impact full builds and not incremental builds.
- The query impacted is `eval_to_allocation_raw` which is what ctfe stresses, so we'll [look into it](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/82936#issuecomment-805029518).

Use TrustedRandomAccess for in-place iterators where possible [#79846](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79846)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=97663b6690689379aa0493deb494dfe14627c46b&end=35385770ae1ea86a911cc44ac43f856831e44b26&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.5% on `full` builds of `deep-vector-debug`)
- This is a change in the standard library that seems to only impact one benchmark: `deep-vector-debug` full compilation. It looks to be impacting `typeck`, but I'm not sure why this would be. It's also possible that it's noise.
- There's also a possibility that this has some strange interaction with the performance gained in [#83360](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83360).

#### Improvements

- Add a check for ASCII characters in to_upper and to_lower [#81358](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81358)
- ast/hir: Rename field-related structures [#83188](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83188)
- Revert performance-sensitive change in #82436 [#83293](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83293)
- Rollup of 9 pull requests [#83360](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83360)
- Simplify encoder and decoder [#83273](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83273)

#### Mixed

- feat: Update hashbrown to instantiate less llvm IR [#77566](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77566)
- Replace closures_captures and upvar_capture with closure_min_captures [#82951](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82951)
- Enable mutable noalias for LLVM >= 12 [#82834](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82834)

#### Nags requiring follow up

- [Issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/82964#issuecomment-800663588) from last week needs to still be addressed.
- This weeks follow-ups:
