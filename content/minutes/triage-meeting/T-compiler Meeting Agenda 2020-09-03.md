### WG checkins

@_WG-rustc-dev-guide_ checkin by @**Santiago Pastorino**:

> - Rewrite/update compiler source code chapter [#765](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/pull/765)
> - Document serialization in rustc [#785](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/pull/785)
> - Expand on the documentation for polymorphization. [#803](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/pull/803)
> - Add basic steps for a new target [#805](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/pull/805)
> - Fix misguided suggestions in config.toml [#840](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/pull/840)
> - Adds documentation to cover spanview output [#844](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/pull/844)
> - @**mark-i-am**, formerly one of the working group leads, [has stepped down](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/until-we-meet-again/12985) on their Rust involvement. @**mark-i-am** was a great co-lead with me and an awesome person to hang with. The work they've done is invaluable and it will be hugely missed.
>
> #### Changes in progress
>
> - Explain stages (take N) [#843](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/pull/843). This is an attempt by @jynelson to explain stages better for new contributors. However, after some discussion on the PR, it's not clear that the new explanation is better than the existing '`--stage N` runs `stageN/rustc`'. Opinions welcome!
> - Name `rustbuild` instead of saying 'the bootstrap binary' [#808](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/pull/808). This needs a consensus that it's actually useful terminology.
> - Fix dep-graph-caller-callee test location [#845](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/pull/845)
> - Update error codes to match the current implementation [#841](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/pull/841)

@_WG-llvm_ checkin by @**nagisa**

> no updates from me, but its more like I didnâ€™t spend too much time looking for things rather than there not being any activity.

## Performance logs

A quiet week for the most part with the exception of two PRs. The first,
[#76027](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76027), was a rather large regression that was soon fixed by [#76030](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76030). The net result seems to be a small improvement overall on optimized and debug builds.

Triage done by @**ecstatic-morse**.

  - Opened by @**eddyb**
  - @**simulacrum** [nominated it to talk about @**eddyb**'s concern wrt to typeid stabilization; it might be a T-lang question too](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75923#issuecomment-684051064).
- "Large performance drop in compiled binary in stable rust 1.45.2 vs 1.44.0 on x86_64 linux" [rust#76247](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76247)
  - Nominated by @_WG-prioritization_ to raise awareness of a runtime performance regression that seems to have started when we upgraded to LLVM 10 and LLVM 11rc2 doesn't fix.
