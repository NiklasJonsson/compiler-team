### WG checkins

@wg-polymorphization checkin by @**davidtwco**:

> Happy new year everyone! There's no news from the polymorphization working group. Working group members have been focusing their efforts elsewhere in the compiler recently.

@_WG-rfc-2229_ by @**nikomatsakis** and @**Matthew Jasper**:

- `capture_disjoint_fields` kind of works now and is available on the nightly.
- PRs for fixing some of the bugs and improving diagnostics are open and more fixes/improvements are currently in the works.
- Parts of the migration (lint) analaysis for handling change in Drop ordering have been implemented, PR is open and will posting follow ups after that.
- Need to discuss with T-lang about edge cases that we realized during the implementation phase of the RFC and an [issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/73) is open for scheduling a meeting.
- [Perf results](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=0f6f2d681b39c5f95459cd09cb936b6ceb27cd82&end=aee064ad665521e03371fbb810437a813fbdd365) after hacking around some of the bugs and enabling the feature by default didn't seem bad. Incremental compile seems to be affected but that is speculated because of duplicate information currently in TypeckResults (requiring more information to hashed). Work is being done to get rid of the duplicate information.

## Performance logs

Happy New Year! A slow week to start off the new year, with by far the most exciting development being the large gains in the `ctfe` benchmark caused by changes in serialization and deserialization.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [e2a2592885539ca97bfb1232669e7519a0c0703b..f4b9d32ef53c0629732ee131b640920ae12d1edb](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=e2a2592885539ca97bfb1232669e7519a0c0703b&end=f4b9d32ef53c0629732ee131b640920ae12d1edb&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

0 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 2 Mixed
2 of them in rollups

#### Improvements

Implement edition-based macro :pat feature [#80459](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80459)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=b33e234155b33ab6bce280fb2445b62b68622b61&end=44e3daf5eee8263dfc3a2509e78ddd1f6f783a0e&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.7% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `deep-vector-check`)
- Fixes the perf regression from [#80100](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80100#issuecomment-750893149)

rustc_serialize: specialize opaque encoding and decoding of some u8 sequences [#80115](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80115)

- Very large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=5986dd878f3e432025eb1946149e3241d3998b1b&end=929f66af9bf587383ed6010403e738e79dfac0d6&stat=instructions:u) (up to -85.1% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `ctfe-stress-4-check`)
- In rustc-serialize, specialize encoding and decoding of some contiguous u8 sequences to use a more efficient implementation.

#### Mixed

Rollup of 9 pull requests [#80530](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80530)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=e2267046859c9ceb932abc983561d53a117089f6&end=9775ffef2a4c3a36cadb58b72ea60cefb92c86ae&stat=instructions:u) (up to 2.6% on `full` builds of `ripgrep-opt`)
- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=e2267046859c9ceb932abc983561d53a117089f6&end=9775ffef2a4c3a36cadb58b72ea60cefb92c86ae&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.5% on `incr-patched: println` builds of `cargo-debug`)
- Unsure which PRs were responsible for the performance impact, but we suspect [#80458](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80458).

Rollup of 12 pull requests [#80708](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80708)

- Large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=9919ad6e9ed113557c68c430de2e0f434e4f5b6e&end=f412fb56b8d11c168e7ee49ee74e79c4ab2e5637&stat=instructions:u) (up to 5.9% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `deeply-nested-async-check`)
- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=9919ad6e9ed113557c68c430de2e0f434e4f5b6e&end=f412fb56b8d11c168e7ee49ee74e79c4ab2e5637&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.4% on `full` builds of `coercions-debug`)
- The regression outweighs the improvement
- Unsure which PR is the cause of the regression, but [#80637](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80637) is our best guess.

#### Nags requiring follow up

- stdarch is still a major contributor to libcore compile times.
- Investigate the two rollups that had perf impacts [#80530](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80530) and [#80708](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80708).
