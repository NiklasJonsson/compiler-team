### WG checkins

@_WG-rls2.0_ checkin by @**matklad**:

> Checkin text

@_WG-self-profile_ checkin by @**Wesley Wiser**:

> We've had quite a lot of activity recently!
>
> - We released `measureme` 0.8 today :tada:
>   - Release highlights:
>     - We have a new storage format contributed by @**mw** that records all of our data in one file instead of three
>     - @**wesleywiser** made some UI tweaks to the `summarize` tool so it's a bit nicer to use. The main one is that we no longer show columns for data that isn't applicable like parallel query blocking time if the compiler wasn't built with parallel support.
>     - @**simulacrum** made it possible to run the analysis tools from perf.rlo without writing profile data to disk.
>     - Several contributors (@**workingjubilee**, @**Aaron1011**, @**wesleywiser**) updated and removed unneeded dependencies :medal:
> - @**mw** has been working on additional improvements so that we can record query keys when building `rustc_middle`. Currently, `rustc_middle` is so large, it exhausts the address space we use for recording string data. [rust-lang/measureme#137](https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme/pull/137) will resolve that and allow us to profile even extremely large crates with query keys enabled. This is a breaking change so `0.9.0` (or perhaps `9.0`) is likely going to ship soon.
> - @**eddyb** continues to work on adding support for reading hardware performance counters like `perf` does instead of using `std::time::Instant` for much more precise timings.

[Unassigned P-high nightly regressions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aregression-from-stable-to-nightly+label%3AP-high+no%3Aassignee)

## Performance logs

Most significant changes this week came in response to regressions discussed in
last week's triage report. Curious readers may be interested in
[#77058](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77058), in which the removal
of a single field from a struct caused a 25% decrease in wall-times for one
seemingly unrelated benchmark, or
[#76986](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76986), an ABI change that
should be a pretty clear win but seems to have mixed results.

Triage done by **@ecstaticmorse**.
Revision range: [b01326ab033e41986d4a5c8b96ce4f40f3b38e30..6369a98ebdee8ce01510f5d4307ddb771c8cb0e5](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=b01326ab033e41986d4a5c8b96ce4f40f3b38e30&end=6369a98ebdee8ce01510f5d4307ddb771c8cb0e5&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

0 Regressions, 1 Improvements, 3 Mixed

0 of them in rollups

### Improvements

[#77041](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77041) perf: move cold path of `process_obligations` into a separate function

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=fadf0257235ddb8a464befc02e50b35652174689&end=521d8d8a2236a239e3327336844ed5948857ea31&stat=instructions:u) (up to -4.8% on `full` builds of `inflate-check`)
- Fixes a regression introduced in [#76575](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76575).

### Mixed

[#77006](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77006) Cache `eval_to_allocation_raw` on disk

- Very large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=893fadd11a52aa26fc19c67ee1b79f03d6a1bed3&end=87d262acb50200d767baa7115f30c650a13672ee&stat=instructions:u) (up to -83.9% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `ctfe-stress-4-check`)
- Large regression in [task clock](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=893fadd11a52aa26fc19c67ee1b79f03d6a1bed3&end=87d262acb50200d767baa7115f30c650a13672ee&stat=task-clock) (up to 14.5% on `incr-full` builds of `ctfe-stress-4-check`),
- Fixes a regression introduced in [#74949](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74949).
- `incr-full` builds of `ctfe-stress-4` also have significantly increased [`max-rss`](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=b01326ab033e41986d4a5c8b96ce4f40f3b38e30&end=6369a98ebdee8ce01510f5d4307ddb771c8cb0e5&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au).
- Real-world benchmarks seem to have mostly improved, however.

[#76913](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76913) Fixing the performance regression of #76244

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=f47df31ae5d7d9795399dca3a0003c1856900361&end=45198456be60a6906d24abdc3c67a31b9206188e&stat=instructions:u) (up to -3.1% on `full` builds of `unicode_normalization-check`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=f47df31ae5d7d9795399dca3a0003c1856900361&end=45198456be60a6906d24abdc3c67a31b9206188e&stat=instructions:u) (up to 2.7% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `ctfe-stress-4-check`)
- A temporary revert of [#76244](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76244) to fix a rather large wall time regression in `unicode-normalization`.
- Gains will reappear as part of [#77257](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77257) with the losses mitigated.

[#76986](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76986) Return values up to 128 bits in registers

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=1ec980d225fff2346a1a631a7ffc88b37e9e18af&end=62fe055aba3ddac5e5d113920cf5fd80522104e2&stat=instructions:u) (up to 2.3% on `full` builds of `deeply-nested-debug`)
- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=1ec980d225fff2346a1a631a7ffc88b37e9e18af&end=62fe055aba3ddac5e5d113920cf5fd80522104e2&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.9% on `full` builds of `piston-image-opt`)
- Seems to be a slight regression overall, even looking at [`task-clock`](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=1ec980d225fff2346a1a631a7ffc88b37e9e18af&end=62fe055aba3ddac5e5d113920cf5fd80522104e2&stat=task-clock) measurements.
