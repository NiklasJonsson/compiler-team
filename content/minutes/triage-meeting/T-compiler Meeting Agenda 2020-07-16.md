@_WG-llvm_ checkin by @**nagisa**:

> - As mentioned above, there’s LLVM11 upgrade on the horizon. The usual caveats etc apply. Potential regressions, improvements in compiler code output etc.
> - In similar spirit been seeing an increased flow of issue reports about sub-optimal code generation, thuogh that's a very subjective evaluation;
> - There's an ongoing effort by a community member to enable building targeting apple silicon with "fat" libraries. There are some complication in enabling this:

    * Upstream LLVM support for this is _dubious_ both now and possibly LLVM 11.
    * What kind of tier are we hoping to have for this target at launch time? I’d say just let it go through the usual process, but I can see logic in idea of having T2/T1 support at launch time.
