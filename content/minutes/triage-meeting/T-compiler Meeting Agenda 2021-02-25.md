### WG checkins

- @\__WG-rfc-2229_ by @**nikomatsakis** @**Matthew Jasper**:

  > - Discussed milestones for edition release: https://github.com/rust-lang/project-rfc-2229/milestones
  > - `disjoint_capture_drop_reorder` lint partly implement to suppport migration around breaking changes across the edition boundry
  > - T-Lang decided on migration syntax to be `catpure!(var)` within a closure to force a complete capture of `var` by the closure.
  > - Implemented better support for precise captures in move closures

- @\__wg-polymorphization_ by @**davidtwco**:
  > There's no news from the polymorphization working group. Working group members have been focusing their efforts elsewhere in the compiler recently.

## Performance logs

[2021-02-24 full Triage Log](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-02-24.md)

Overall, a positive week for compiler performance with only one moderate regression. The change that introduced the regression leads to significantly improved [bootstrap speed](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70951#issuecomment-766292996) of the compiler as well as easier maintainability.

Triage done by **@rylev**.

1 Regression, 5 Improvements, 0 Mixed
0 of them in rollups

#### Regressions

- Move the query engine out of rustc_middle [#70951](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70951)
  - Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=e7c23ab933ebc1f205c3b59f4ebc85d40f67d404&end=83b30a639d5abd1270ade35d9bd92271f5a5ba18&stat=instructions:u) (up to 4.9% on `full` builds of `deeply-nested-check`)
  - While this does somewhat hurt compiler performance, it is a huge gain in bootstrap speed. The performance impact was deemed acceptable, but perhaps an investigation in if the remaining performance regressions can be eliminated, should be looked into.
  - Added a nag to [the pull request](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70951#issuecomment-785044935).

#### Improvements

- Only store a LocalDefId in some HIR nodes [#81611](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81611)
- Inline try_get_cached [#82197](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82197)
- Reduce size of InterpErrorInfo to 8 bytes [#82116](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82116)
- Make the `Query` enum a simple struct. [#80891](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80891)
- Improve assert_eq! and assert_ne! [#79100](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79100)

#### Nags requiring follow up

- One nag for the only regression for the week.

  - issue seems to warrant high priority but since it looks to be in the codebase since long, we are not sure about the implications/impact
