### WG checkins

@_WG-rls2.0_ checkin by @**matklad**:

> #### [RFC2912](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2912) progress:
>
> - protocol conformance problems mostly fixed (there are no incompats which are known to cause significant issues, there might be some de-jure bugs though)
> - all protocol extensions are documented at: https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/docs/dev/lsp-extensions.md
> - Upstream issues: https://github.com/microsoft/language-server-protocol/issues/created_by/matklad
> - Subscribe to https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/4604 to receive notifications about new extensions.
> - shipping via rustup is in progress: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72978
> - currently soft-blocked on someone figuring out building from vendored sources (needs just impl work)
> - initial support of rust-analyzer in the official rust-lang extension (using rust-analyzer extension is still recommended though)
>
> #### Org progress:
>
> - @**Jonas Schievink** joined rust-analyzer.
>   We finally have a shared expert between rustc and rust-analyzer, :tada:
> - Rate of PRs exceeds review capacity.
> - Official help and discussion forum category: https://users.rust-lang.org/c/ide/14
>
> #### Impl progress:
>
> - Documentation for features is now generated from the source code, and contains links to the source code:
>   https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#features.
> - (as of yesterday) new semantic-less IR (`ItemTree`) to avoid repeated reparsing of files.
> - A bunch of perf & memory usage improvements.
> - Semantic syntax highlighting of doc comments.
> - Chalk updates and various assorted fixes to the type inference.
> - Better support for non-cargo based projects.
> - New (final hopefully?) implementation of Virtual File System

@_WG-self-profile_ checkin by @**Wesley Wiser**:

> - Some other Rust projects have shown interest in using `measureme` in their crates.
>   Boa, a JavaScript interpreter written in Rust, has done the integration [with some cool results](https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/pull/317#issuecomment-636464496).
> - We've made a few small changes to the `summarize` command output to hide columns that are rustc specific when that data isn't present.
> - @**Wesley Wiser** has started working on a tool to "blame" compile time to `DefId`s.
>   - It's too early to really show anything off because it barely works at all.
>   - One major issue is that we can't see inside LLVM so ~80% of compilation time for crates tested so far is just blamed to LLVM. That's not particularly useful.

### P-critical

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AP-critical+label%3AT-compiler)

- "Slice index becomes wrong (beta regression)" [#73223](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73223)
  - It's a regression from stable to beta
  - [PR is merged already on nightly](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73262)
  - It's beta accepted, so this is waiting for the actual backport
- "ICE: MIR const-checker found novel structural match violation" [#73431](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73431)
  - ICE when matching with a trait constant
  - Beta regression caused by [#67343](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67343) (@**ecstatic-morse**)
  - [PR is merged already on nightly](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73446)
  - It's beta accepted, so this is waiting for the actual backport
- "cannot create local mono-item for DefId" [#73537](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73537)

  - [This seems to be fixed seeing some of the latest comments](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73537#issuecomment-649364509), still needs a test.

[libs-impl](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AP-critical+label%3Alibs-impl)

- No P-critical issues for libs-impl this time.
