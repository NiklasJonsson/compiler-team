- @_wg-incr-comp_ by @**Wesley Wiser**
  > We've restarted our bi-weekly meetings after skipping a few at the end of last year for the holidays.
  >
  > There's been a lot of work around the incremental/query system in rustc recently:
  >
  > - @cjgillot has been working on moving HIR attributes into a side table instead of storing them directly on various HIR types with the goal of reducing incr-comp invalidations due to attributes changing. [#79519](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79519)
  > - @tgnottingham has been doing a lot of work to reduce memory usage, improve performance and improve code quality :tada: [#80957](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80957), [#80602](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80602), [#80463](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80463), [#80177](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80177) and [#79589](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79589)
  > - @mw has been experimenting with writing a hash table that uses the same binary representation both on disk and in-memory with goal of reducing serialization and deserialization costs for the `DefPathTable`. [Zulip thread](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/241847-t-compiler.2Fwg-incr-comp/topic/Lazy.20DefPathTable.20decoding), [hash table implementation](https://github.com/michaelwoerister/odht)

[libs-impl](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AP-critical+label%3AT-libs-impl)

- "File implementation on Windows has unsound methods" [rust#81357](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81357)
  - an unsoundness on how Rust handles the Windows I/O API, should be probably marked as critical. we don't have a MVCE from a Windows user, but possibly it's been there since long time.
  - [libs meeting report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81357#issuecomment-768607504) by @**Ashley Mannix**: seems the consensus is ack one of the options suggested by the issue reporter (call `GetOverlappedResult` and if it returns error, call `abort()`)
  - not yet assigned, @**Arlie Davis** [volunteered last week](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/238009-t-compiler.2Fmeetings/topic/.5Bweekly.20meeting.5D.202021-01-28.20.2354818/near/224342001) to have a look at it

[T-rustdoc](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AP-critical+label%3AT-rustdoc)

### P-high regressions

[P-high beta regressions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aregression-from-stable-to-beta+label%3AP-high)

- "Cross-compiling Rust to s390x yields a faulty toolchain" [rust#80810](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80810)
  - Opened by [Jakob-Naucke](https://github.com/Jakob-Naucke)
  - previously discussed, assigned to @**pnkfelix**
  - Note: this issue is up for grab for anyone willing to follow it up
  - seems to affect specifically s390x or to be related to endianess
  - Issue not yet completely clear, could be checked against PR [#80732](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80732) (not ready for merge yet)
  - @**cuviper** comments that this issue [could also be unrelated to endianess](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80810#issuecomment-761253970)
- "regression 1.50: Duplicate symbol linker error" [rust#80951](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80951)
  - opened by @**rylev**
  - regression on crate [utxo-oracle](https://github.com/devrandom/utxo-oracle) that compiled on 1.49 (see [logs](https://crater-reports.s3.amazonaws.com/beta-1.50-1/beta-2021-01-01/gh/devrandom.utxo-oracle/log.txt))
  - @**Frank Steffahn** adds that [doesn't look like a genuine regression](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80951#issuecomment-768602173)
  - @**apiraino** asks (out of curiosity): the crate imports a bitcoin library, the project does not seems very active and the [scope is unclear](https://github.com/devrandom/utxo-oracle/blob/master/src/main.rs) to me. Worth checking when was this crate added and why? Does it have specific code to be monitored between releases?
- "regression 1.50: Borrow checker reports function param as not living long enough" [rust#80949](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80949)
  - opened by @**rylev**, emerged in crater run for 1.50
  - [Smallest MCVE found](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80949#issuecomment-759432282) points to PR [#78373](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78373)
  - @**Matthew Jasper** comments that pr #78373 [caused MIR to have one fewer basic block](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80949#issuecomment-760019484) which reduced borrowck precision
  - @**Matthew Jasper** added [additional details ](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80949#issuecomment-760417066)
  - @**pnkfelix** is working on PR [rust#81257](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/81257) to revert [rust#78373](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78373) and fix this issue
- "regression 1.50: deny after forbid breaks build" [rust#80988](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80988)
  - Opened by @**rylev**, emerged in crater run for 1.50
  - Assigned to @**pnkfelix**
  - possibly related to issue [#77713](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77713)
  - @**simulacrum** points to PR [#78864](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78864) and figures out [the root cause](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80988#issuecomment-761622611)
  - discussed in the [T-lang meeting](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80988#issuecomment-763096218), the decision would be to close this
  - @**pnkfelix** [comments](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80988#issuecomment-763874759) that the specific issue discussed in the RFC is probably best dealt in issue [#81218](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81218)
  - **_final-comment-period is canceled_**
  - will be a future-incompatibility warning, @**nikomatsakis** is working on make it so
- "beta regression: forbid(warnings) interacts poorly with common derives." [rust#81218](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81218)
  - Spawned from above issue [rust#80988](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80988) ([discussed last week](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/238009-t-compiler.2Fmeetings/topic/.5Bweekly.20meeting.5D.202021-01-21.20.2354818/near/223527544)) to address specifically `forbid` and `derive` interacting surprisingly
  - @**simulacrum** [added some comments](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81218#issuecomment-766500893) after last week's discussion
  - Assigned to @**simulacrum**
  - same for [rust#80988](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80988) @**nikomatsakis** is working to make it a future-incompatibility warning

[Unassigned P-high nightly regressions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aregression-from-stable-to-nightly+label%3AP-high+no%3Aassignee)

## Performance logs

> [2021-02-02 Triage Log](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-02-02.md)

Another week dominated by rollups, most of which had relatively small changes with unclear causes embedded. Overall no major changes in performance this week.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.

2 Regressions, 1 Improvements, 1 Mixed
3 of them in rollups

#### Regressions

Rollup of 12 pull requests [#81625](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81625)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=70b18bc2cbac4712020019f5bf57c00905373205&end=02b85d722050d61b40ae9746b3bac54ab55b1056&stat=instructions:u) (up to 3.3% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `match-stress-enum-check`)
- Unclear responsible PR. Nothing in this rollup stands out, and self-profile
  information does not reveal obvious causes.

Add visitors for checking #[inline] [#80641](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80641)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=02b85d722050d61b40ae9746b3bac54ab55b1056&end=d4e3570db4c007089035b833cc20c7fc2f8cb32f&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.7% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `unicode_normalization-check`)
- Primarily limited to incremental benchmarks; we are simply visiting more nodes
  for this check, so it is unsurprising that we take a performance hit.

#### Improvements

- Rollup of 13 pull requests [#81461](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81461)

#### Mixed

- Rollup of 10 pull requests [#81493](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81493)

#### Nags requiring follow up

From last week:

- Deprecate in future regression [#80958](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80958#issuecomment-767837811)
  - Some commentary in response but seems likely this will not be addressed
    one way or another.
- Waiting on [response](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80919#issuecomment-767854932) to inquiry.
  - Some investigation in [#81476](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81476), potentially regression was down to a bugfix.
- Regression in prevent query cycles in the MIR inliner - expected? [#68828](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68828#issuecomment-767872361)
  - No updates yet from @**oli** on their investigation.
