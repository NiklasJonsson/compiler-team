### WG checkins

- @_WG-rls2.0_ by @**Lukas Wirth** ([previous checkin](https://hackmd.io/f45z2GqQTNW9QH0wO4lTEg?view)):

> Steering issue covered by this checkin:
>
> - https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/9925
>   This sprint has seen a lot of improvements and fixes for experimental attribute support bringing the feature closer to being enabled by default.
>   We fixed a memory leak in our [syntax tree library](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rowan/pull/112) as well as improving [compile times a bunch](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/pull/10069).
>   Our parser has seen some cleanups and we started implementing IDE support for macros reusing spans for multiple output tokens.

- @_WG-rfc-2229_ by @**nikomatsakis** and @**Matthew Jasper** ([previous checkin](https://hackmd.io/f45z2GqQTNW9QH0wO4lTEg?view)):
  > This is shipping with Rust 2021, but there are some backports for a few bugs
  > I have to prepare a patch today for one of those:
  > https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89144
  > So one thing is this code that helps the migration by skipping "insignificant destructors"
  > and the other is an edge case in destructor ordering
  > (if you capture all the fields of a struct, then we will drop them in the order of use, but we used to drop them in the order in which they appeared in the struct)
  > (this is because the closure now has a separate variable for each field)
  > (I'll probably add some sorting to preserve the old order "just because", but there is an interesting question of what guarantees (if any) we give around this sort of thing -- I am thinking "none")
  > I guess that's a lang question but perhaps people here have an opinion :)

#### Mixed

Const drop [#88558](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88558)

- Large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=c3c0f80d6081092faff801542dd82f0e2420152b&end=cdeba02ff71416e014f7130f75166890688be986&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.7% on `full` builds of `externs`)
- Large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=c3c0f80d6081092faff801542dd82f0e2420152b&end=cdeba02ff71416e014f7130f75166890688be986&stat=instructions:u) (up to 2.7% on `full` builds of `html5ever`)
- Regression addressed by followup PRs [#88965](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88965) (which has landed) and [#88963](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88963) (which has not yet landed).

Introduce a fast path that avoids the `debug_tuple` abstraction when deriving Debug for unit-like enum variants. [#88832](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88832)

- Very large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=e36621057d9f497c822eb800934b5933c10510cf&end=78a46efff06558674b51c10d8d81758285746ab5&stat=instructions:u) (up to -4.5% on `full` builds of `stm32f4`)
- Large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=e36621057d9f497c822eb800934b5933c10510cf&end=78a46efff06558674b51c10d8d81758285746ab5&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.3% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `ctfe-stress-4`)
- Already [triaged by simulacrum](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/88832#issuecomment-919967148), noting that the instruction count regressions are justified because the same benchmarks do not regress in cycles.

Remove concept of 'completion' from the projection cache [#88945](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88945)

- Small improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=1c03f0d0ba4fee54b7aa458f4d3ad989d8bf7b34&end=e0c38af27cb5f6f961809601b717d6afc3b190ee&stat=instructions:u) (up to -0.3% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `helloworld`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=1c03f0d0ba4fee54b7aa458f4d3ad989d8bf7b34&end=e0c38af27cb5f6f961809601b717d6afc3b190ee&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.8% on `full` builds of `wg-grammar`)
- Wrote [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/88945#issuecomment-924384164) noting that scope of regression was limited but might still be worth investigating, at least briefly.

Simplify lazy DefPathHash decoding by using an on-disk hash table. [#82183](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82183)

- Very large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=23afad6e7f0ff17320411a274f3a3beb92452235&end=d6cd2c6c877110748296760aefddc21a0ea1d316&stat=instructions:u) (up to -7.7% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `deeply-nested`)
- Small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=23afad6e7f0ff17320411a274f3a3beb92452235&end=d6cd2c6c877110748296760aefddc21a0ea1d316&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.9% on `incr-full` builds of `coercions`)
- [Triaged](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/82183#issuecomment-924367405): the wins here massively outweigh the few slight losses.

Gather module items after lowering. [#88703](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88703)

- Large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=697118d23eaa5d59940befabedcafbaceaf61a1c&end=7b5f95270f1ef7118ef4d3b47428054d23113ad5&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.3% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `ctfe-stress-4`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=697118d23eaa5d59940befabedcafbaceaf61a1c&end=7b5f95270f1ef7118ef4d3b47428054d23113ad5&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.8% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `tuple-stress`)
  https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88703
- Wrote [wishy-washy comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/88703#issuecomment-924388131) noting that this is indeed a mixed result and it may not be worth investigating, but didn't pull trigger on adding triaged label.

Querify `FnAbi::of_{fn_ptr,instance}` as `fn_abi_of_{fn_ptr,instance}`. [#88575](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88575)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=5ecc8ad8462574354a55162a0c16b10eb95e3e70&end=91198820d7e697def79177c022b5e98b3d482ddc&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.0% on `full` builds of `regression-31157`)
- Large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=5ecc8ad8462574354a55162a0c16b10eb95e3e70&end=91198820d7e697def79177c022b5e98b3d482ddc&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.4% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `regression-31157`)
- Left [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/88575#issuecomment-924402503) that didn't even bother to take time to be wishy-washy.

Use <[T; N]>::map in Sharded instead of SmallVec and unsafe code [#89069](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89069)

- Small improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=db1fb85cff63ad5fffe435e17128f99f9e1d970c&end=3bb9eecf07630be796c587a4bba70c49ae6a1bae&stat=instructions:u) (up to -0.3% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `ucd`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=db1fb85cff63ad5fffe435e17128f99f9e1d970c&end=3bb9eecf07630be796c587a4bba70c49ae6a1bae&stat=instructions:u) (up to 2.8% on `incr-full` builds of `ctfe-stress-4`)
- Left [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89069#issuecomment-924405935); the estimated effect looks pretty different from when the PR was filed vs when it landed, but either way it is probably noise.

Lower only one HIR owner at a time [#87234](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87234)

- Large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=e7958d35ca2c898a223efe402481e0ecb854310a&end=49c0861ed0fa1d95186d88df0cd4310103e70957&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.3% on `full` builds of `unused-warnings`)
- Small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=e7958d35ca2c898a223efe402481e0ecb854310a&end=49c0861ed0fa1d95186d88df0cd4310103e70957&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.4% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `helloworld`)
