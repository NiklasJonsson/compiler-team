### WG checkins

@_WG-rfc-2229_ checkin by @**nikomatsakis** and @**Matthew Jasper**:

- PR (#78801) in review for implementing precise capture analysis, and adding feature gate for 2229 `capture_disjoint_fields`
- Known issue: Statements like `let _ = x` will make the compiler ICE when used within a closure with the feature enabled. More generally speaking the issue is caused by let statements that create no bindings and are init'ed using a Place expression.
- Immediate next work: start updating MIR lowering

@_WG-rls2.0_ checkin by @**matklad**:

Nothing super big happened, the last couple of months were rather quite.

- a lot of quality-of-life improvements, assits & buf fixes
- rust-analyzer pre-warms caches on startup, whihc should reduce latency in some cases.
- improved syntax tree editing infra, which powers new configurable auto-import
- better support for conditional compilation (un-cfged code is grayed out)
- hack to support `cfg-if` in standard libray.
  This is a bit of an open question: how rust-analyzer should deal with crates.io deps of std? They are not vendored into rust-src component. Might be changing soon!

Note to @matklad: The last changelog as of this checkin is https://rust-analyzer.github.io/thisweek/2020/11/09/changelog-50.html

## Performance logs

A mixed week with improvements still outweighing regressions. Perhaps the biggest highlight was the move to compiling rustc crates [with the initial-exec TLS model](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78201) which results in fewer calls to `_tls_get_addr` and thus faster compile times.

Triage done by **@rylevick**.

1 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 2 Mixed

### Regressions

[#78267](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78267)

- Small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=f92b931045dabb00b892519d3451cb41d41f2d31&end=8532e742fc6ec210fab69b8192190bc40c685912&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.2% on `full` builds of `deeply-nested-async-check`)
- This might be noise as this only affects one benchmark negatively, and that benchmark tends to be on the noisier side.

### Improvements

[#78280](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78280)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=75f1db1102076e416e1154b241b4fc95c01c0d7b&end=89631663b7ad2d46d3e4f52bcfa7bee2be9eb82b&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.3% on `incr-patched: new row` builds of `tuple-stress-opt`)

[#78201](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78201)

- Large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=fe8f02690804d5ee696bd3bca9515f5f71857e3b&end=25f6938da459a57b43bdf16ed6bdad3225b2a3ce&stat=instructions:u) (up to -7.2% on `incr-full` builds of `webrender-wrench-check`)
- This change may produce similar performance gains in related tooling such as rustdoc and clippy.

### Mixed

[#77227](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77227)

- Large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=601c13c6fda6a7db423c974797e36c79a9a0c0ac&end=75f1db1102076e416e1154b241b4fc95c01c0d7b&stat=instructions:u) (up to -5.0% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `deeply-nested-async-check`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=601c13c6fda6a7db423c974797e36c79a9a0c0ac&end=75f1db1102076e416e1154b241b4fc95c01c0d7b&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.3% on `full` builds of `ctfe-stress-4-check`)

[#78410](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78410)

- Very large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=f2ea2f648e117013b0217f001088ae89e0f163ca&end=87a0997ef9c0bfad0ba362741afa601d8fb285b8&stat=instructions:u) (up to -26.0% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `deeply-nested-async-opt`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=f2ea2f648e117013b0217f001088ae89e0f163ca&end=87a0997ef9c0bfad0ba362741afa601d8fb285b8&stat=instructions:u) (up to 3.8% on `full` builds of `ctfe-stress-4-check`)
- This change is a revert of [a previous change](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75443), and at least one user was reporting [massive performance gains](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78410#issuecomment-716829861).
