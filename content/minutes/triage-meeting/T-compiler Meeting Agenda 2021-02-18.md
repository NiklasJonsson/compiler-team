# T-compiler Meeting Agenda 2021-02-18

[Tracking Issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54818)

## Announcements

- We have no steering meeting tomorrow (Friday). We spent last week's planning meeting doing ad-hoc planning for the March sprint.

### WG checkins

@_WG-mir-opt_ checkin by @**oli**:

- Prevent query cycles in the MIR inliner https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68828
  - This is done by finding recursion sites in unoptimized MIR right before the unoptimized MIR body is stolen from its query in order to get optimized. Hopefully this is the last large barrier in enabling MIR inlining by default.
- Duplicate MIR of `const fn` (one optimized version for runtime and one unoptimized version for CTFE): https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78407
  - This allows CTFE to detect more UB (since the UB didn't get optimized away) and generally looks like a good entry point for static analyses that want to consume MIR.
- General trend: some intrinsics are lowered to dedicated MIR statements right after borrowck is done. This makes it easier to write optimizations around these intrinsics and makes it clear that some intrinsics cannot possibly unwind, because MIR statements cannot unwind.

@_WG-polonius_ checkin by @**lqd**:

> a small update this time:
>
> - more work has been done on sharing results between the quick `LocationInsensitive` pre-pass and the full location-sensitive analysis that follows, to limit the costlier work done in the full analysis by using the information gathered in the pre-pass
> - unfortunately no news on the future sprint yet, or reviews/progress on the already completed work for the sprint that we mentioned at the previous check-in

  - Win7 (x86_64-pc-windows-gnu) is still [Tier 1 platform](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html#tier-1): a side question about this issue could be if it should be demoted
  - the problem disappears if reverting to [nightly-2021-01-12](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81051#issuecomment-769520843) or up to LLVM [commit 6ec777c](https://github.com/rust-lang/llvm-project/commit/6ec777c)
  - @**moxian** [debugged the issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81051#issuecomment-774638526) and provides significant data and points to rollup PR [#80960](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80960)

## Performance logs

> [2021-02-16 Full triage logs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-02-16.md)

A mostly quiet week, though with an excellent improvement in bootstrap times,
shaving off a couple percent off the total and 10% off of rustc_middle due to
changes in the code being compiled.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.

1 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 1 Mixed

#### Regressions

Initialize BTree nodes directly in the heap [#81494](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81494)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=7e0241c63755ea28045d512b742f50b307874419&end=3c10a880eca60379343a6c6d19dd5bda38ead55d&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.3% on `full` builds of `cargo-debug`)
- Not really expected, but this is aiming for optimizing initialization of large
  k/v pairs, so perhaps worth it. Left a nag.

#### Improvements

- [experiment] remove `#[inline]` from rustc_query_system::plumbing [#81892](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81892)
- directly expose copy and copy_nonoverlapping intrinsics [#81238](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81238)

#### Mixed

- Check the result cache before the DepGraph when ensuring queries [#81855](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81855)

#### Nags requiring follow up

Investigations pending:

- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/81494#issuecomment-779938322
- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/81855#issuecomment-779950478
  - comment by [@cjgillot](https://github.com/cjgillot): "Follow-up PR #82197 recovers the expected perf gain."

From last week:

- Waiting on more investigation in [#81476](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81476).
- Need to follow up on the regressions reported this week.

  - issue seems to warrant high priority but since it looks like to be there since long, we are not sure about the implications/impact
