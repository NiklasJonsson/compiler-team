### WG checkins

@_WG-self-profile_ by @**mw** and @**Wesley Wiser** ([previous checkin](https://hackmd.io/VNIxtjGBT8Owfkb92Vzt6w#WG-checkins)):

> @rylev and @mw have been working towards recording non-timestamp data like the sizes of files that the compiler emits â€“ e.g. object files and incr. comp. on-disk data as part of the self-profile infrastructure. This hasn't quite landed yet, but significant progress has been made.

> We've also introduced new apis that allow reading older versions of the on-disk data which will help perf.rlo work more smoothly as new versions are released.

## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2021-09-28](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-09-28.md)

The largest story for the week are the massive improvements that come from enabling the new pass manager in LLVM which leads to consistent 5% to 30% improvements across almost all test cases. The regressions were mostly minor with clear paths for addressing the ones that were not made with some specific trade off in mind.

Triage done by **@rylev**. Revision range: [7743c9fadd64886d537966ba224b9c20e6014a59..83f147b3baf21acfc367a6da1045d212cd3957e4](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=7743c9fadd64886d537966ba224b9c20e6014a59&end=83f147b3baf21acfc367a6da1045d212cd3957e4&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

4 Regressions, 4 Improvements, 3 Mixed; 0 of them in rollups
43 comparisons made in total

#### Regressions

Revise never type fallback algorithm [#88804](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88804)

- Large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=2b862bed9889808b69629fd7246317189b9517a5&end=900cf5e8905ba8a2a9c99a1dfc9cb2cf4754d77a&stat=instructions:u) (up to 2.7% on `full` builds of `keccak`)

Introduce `Rvalue::ShallowInitBox` [#89030](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89030)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=218a96cae06ed1a47549a81c09c3655fbcae1363&end=e9f29a851917a706c01b6f51331894df1d15770b&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.9% on `incr-patched: println` builds of `syn`)
- Perf regression is happening in real-world optimized builds which we would expect if we're making LLVM do more work.
- The author has an idea for how to reduce the pressure on LLVM and perhaps win back some of the perf, but was unsure if the regression was large enough to warrant that investigation.
- Left a comment asking the author to think about prioritizing that [investigation](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89030#issuecomment-929187148).

Fix spacing of links in inline code. [#88343](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88343)

- Large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=9620f3a84b079decfdc2e557be007580b097fe43&end=addb4da686a97da46159f0123cb6cdc2ce3d7fdb&stat=instructions:u) (up to 2.1% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `webrender-wrench`)
- This change is only in doc comments for the standard library so large regressions are quite surprising.
- This has impacted the incr-unchanged scenario of only one benchmark. Perhaps the docs led to a change in how incremental cache was being stored which could have an impact?

Suggest both of immutable and mutable trait implementations [#89263](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89263)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=583437a6dd58ee266839d2dac940642a0752a6dd&end=3e8f32e1c52ca493c862facb7a69e7c3f1f97a18&stat=instructions:u) (up to 2.0% on `full` builds of `diesel`)
- The regression occurs in `evaluate_obligation` which seems like it would be effected by this change, but the only impacted benchmark is diesel doc which doesn't trigger this diagnostic
- The change is large enough though that it being noise would be quite surprising.
- Left a [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89263#issuecomment-929511988)

#### Improvements

- Migrate in-tree crates to 2021 [#89103](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89103)
- Disable visible path calculation for PrettyPrinter in Ok path of compiler [#89120](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89120)
- Make `Duration` respect `width` when formatting using `Debug` [#88999](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88999)
- Enable new pass manager with LLVM 13 [#88243](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88243)

#### Mixed

Use ZST for fmt unsafety [#89139](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89139)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=30278d3cf92b581550933546370443a5d5700002&end=67365d64bcdfeae1334bf2ff49587c27d1c973f0&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.6% on `full` builds of `cranelift-codegen`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=30278d3cf92b581550933546370443a5d5700002&end=67365d64bcdfeae1334bf2ff49587c27d1c973f0&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.5% on `full` builds of `deeply-nested-async`)
- The regressions were already triaged [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89139#issuecomment-927914624).

Support `#[track_caller]` on closures and generators [#87064](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87064)

- Large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=15d9ba0133ce0b35348e1c8367afe00aec841ffa&end=0132f8258ae0fbc4f2b461b28d510222d22aa979&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.8% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `webrender-wrench`)
- Small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=15d9ba0133ce0b35348e1c8367afe00aec841ffa&end=0132f8258ae0fbc4f2b461b28d510222d22aa979&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.5% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `helloworld`)
- The large majority of performance regressions were quite small and many were historically noisy benchmarks.
- Looking at the non-noisy benchmarks nothing seemed to stand out as a clear culprit. -
- There were some test cases that indicated large jumps in incr_comp_persist_dep_graph but this did not hold true across all incremental test cases, and nothing in the changes seemed to jump out at me as potentially causing this issue.
- Added a [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87064#issuecomment-929428658) in the PR asking for additional opinions.

Don't normalize opaque types with escaping late-bound regions [#89285](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89285)

- Very large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=3e8f32e1c52ca493c862facb7a69e7c3f1f97a18&end=2b6ed3b675475abc01ce7e68bb75b457f0c85684&stat=instructions:u) (up to -86.7% on `full` builds of `issue-88862`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=3e8f32e1c52ca493c862facb7a69e7c3f1f97a18&end=2b6ed3b675475abc01ce7e68bb75b457f0c85684&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.3% on `full` builds of `deeply-nested-async`)
- This has already been [triaged](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89285#issuecomment-927417324).
- Essentially it's a targeted fix for a severe perf regression that can happen in limited circumstances. The fix will be backported to the latest beta.
