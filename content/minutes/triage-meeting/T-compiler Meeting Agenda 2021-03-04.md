### WG checkins

@_WG-rls2.0_ by @**matklad**
We've finished our first 6 weeks "sprint" ([tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/7325#issuecomment-788222235)) with mixed results

- rust-analyzer now supprts items declared inside function bodies
- we are preparing to enable proc-macro suport by default. In particular, rust-analyzer suppors asynchronous execution of build scripts and loading of proc-macro.
- we've switched macro-by-example parser to use a proper NFA, getting closer to parity with rustc at the cost of 2x worser expansion performance :(
- "new mutable immutable syntax trees" work is still not finished, but it has progressed enough to rewrite one assist to confirm that the new API works and is significantly more ergonomic.

@_WG-self-profile_ by @**Wesley Wiser**:

> - We released `measureme@9.1` last week :tada: ([release notes](https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme/releases/tag/9.1.0))
>   - The biggest feature is @eddyb's support for hardware performance counters
>   - We've updated rustc to use the new version
>   - This has unblocked [@eddyb's PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78781) to use hardware performance counters for `-Zself-profile`

2 Regressions, 3 Improvements, 0 Mixed, 0 of them in rollups

#### Regressions

Use correct param_env in conservative_is_privately_uninhabited [#82159](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82159)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=a8486b64b0c87dabd045453b6c81500015d122d6&end=1fdadbf13aecd190b277ea2aa1b125d2ed986d55&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.2% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `regression-31157-opt`)
- Seems like a necessary bugfix.

Detect match statement intended to be tail expression [#81458](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81458)

- Large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=d95d30486180387a875b14633aea4e4dd8f960da&end=cecdb181ade91c0a5ffab9a148dba68fc7d00ee3&stat=instructions:u) (up to 5.6% on `incr-patched: println` builds of `unicode_normalization-check`)
- Unexpected regresssion, left [nag](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/81458#issuecomment-789003548).

#### Improvements

- Prevent to compute Item attributes twice [#82265](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82265)
- Miscellaneous inlining improvements [#82559](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82559)
- Remove storage markers if they won't be used during code generation [#78360](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78360)

#### Nags requiring follow up

Detect match statement intended to be tail expression [#81458](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81458)

  - opened by @**Frank Steffahn**
  - issue bisection seems to point to PR [#73905](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73905)

  - something to investigate a bit closer
