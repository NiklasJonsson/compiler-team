### P-critical

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AP-critical+label%3AT-compiler)

- "cannot create local mono-item for DefId" [rust#73537](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73537)
  - Discussed last week
  - [Labeled as `P-critical` to raise awareness](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/227806-t-compiler.2Fwg-prioritization/topic/I-prioritize.20.2373537.20cannot.20create.20local.20mono-item.20for.20DefId)
  - [This seems to be fixed seeing some of the latest comments](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73537#issuecomment-649364509), still needs a test.
  - Maybe we should lower the priority to `P-medium` or something that represents the priority of lacking a test in the compiler.
- "Nightly ICEs trying to normalize during a cast" [rust#73747](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73747)
  - Unassigned
  - nightly regression, ICE on previously accepted code
  - still needs MCVE and bisection
  - current repro code uses WinRT and thus is only reproducible on Windows

[libs-impl](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AP-critical+label%3Alibs-impl)

- No P-critical issues for libs-impl this time.

[T-rustdoc](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AP-critical+label%3AT-rustdoc)

- No P-critical issues for T-rustdoc this time.

    - [@**nagisa** believes it's dangerous and also limits our possibilities in the future](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71481#discussion_r436266259)
    - [@**nikomatsakis** expressed that we might accidentally stabilize struct fields without intending to](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71481#discussion_r439594190)
- "Rename TypeckTables to TypeckResults." [rust#72983](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72983)

  - [@**nikomatsakis** thinks that the name is objectively better here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72983#issuecomment-652498948)
  - Nominated to draw attention to it, people should be aware of the change

[libs-impl](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-nominated+label%3Alibs-impl)
