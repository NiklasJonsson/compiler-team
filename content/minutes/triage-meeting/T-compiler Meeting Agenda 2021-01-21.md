### WG checkins

@_WG-traits_ checkin by @nikomatsakis and @Jack Huey:

> Last week we held a meeting to discuss our next steps.
> We were looking specifically at "async fn in traits" and what it would take to support that within the compiler.
> We identified a path of incremental support by enabling other features.
> There are [meeting notes](https://hackmd.io/j8KTAWU2TzC-STlsB8ZSVQ) available here and a recording will be posted.
> We've also been making progress towards refactoring and type library work;
> the [2021-01-12 meeting](https://zulip-archive.rust-lang.org/144729wgtraits/40141meeting20210112.html)
> contains a good summary. -nikomatsakis
> We're also planning to try out the "sprint week" instead of the 6 week sprints we have been using so far. We haven't set the dates yet, though.

## Beta-nominations

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Abeta-nominated+-label%3Abeta-accepted+label%3AT-compiler)

- "Make hitting the recursion limit in projection non-fatal" [rust#81055](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/81055)

  - Opened by @**Matthew Jasper**
  - Assigned to @**nikomatsakis** not yet r'ed
  - This patch goes with merged PR [#80953](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80953) (infinite loop bug in caching normalization of projections) making reaching the recursion limit not fatal.
  - This should fix regression not caught in [the crater run](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80953#issuecomment-759347129) and appeared in stable 1.49 and that breaks compiling production code
  - related to PR [#80246](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80246) already merged

- "rustc_parse_format: Fix character indices in find_skips" [rust#81071](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/81071)
  - opened by @**osa1**
  - fixes [#81006](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81006), a `P-medium` issue, incorrect format string/argument mismatch triggering an ICE
  - r'ed by @**Esteban KÃ¼ber**, [suggests beta backport](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/81071#issuecomment-761605595) to deploy the patch sooner and reduce user experiencing this error

  - @**oli** suggests to [put it into mir-opt-level=3 and merge](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77551#issuecomment-753640105), then re-evaluate the spans and other performance improvements

[P-high beta regressions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aregression-from-stable-to-beta+label%3AP-high)

- "Cross-compiling Rust to s390x yields a faulty toolchain" [rust#80810](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80810)
  - Opened by [Jakob-Naucke](https://github.com/Jakob-Naucke)
  - Assigned to @**pnkfelix**
  - mentioned last week
  - seems to affect specific s390x or to be related to endianess
  - Need to checked against PR [#80732](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80732) (ready for review)
- "regression 1.50: Borrow checker reports function param as not living long enough" [rust#80949](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80949)
  - opened by @**rylev**, emerged in crater run for 1.50
  - [Smallest MCVE found](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80949#issuecomment-759432282) points to PR [#78373](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78373)
  - @**Matthew Jasper** comments that pr #78373 [caused MIR to have one fewer basic block](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80949#issuecomment-760019484) which reduced borrowck precision
  - @**Matthew Jasper** added [more details to the PR](the question of a revert for later, after we get more data about impact regression has on ecosystem)
- "regression 1.50: deny after forbid breaks build" [rust#80988](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80988)
  - Opened by @**rylev**, emerged in crater run for 1.50
  - possibly related to issue [#77713](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77713)
  - @**simulacrum** self assigns this issue, points to PR [#78864](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78864) and figures out [the root cause](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80988#issuecomment-761622611)
  - discussed in the [T-lang meeting](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80988#issuecomment-763096218), the decision would be to close this
  - @**pnkfelix** [comments](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80988#issuecomment-763874759) that the specific issue discussed in the RFC is probably best dealt in issue [#81218](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81218)
- "beta regression: forbid(warnings) interacts poorly with common derives." [rust#81218](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81218)
  - see :point_up_2: but to address specifically `forbid` and `derive` interacting surprisingly

## Performance logs

[2021-01-20 Triage full log](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-01-20.md)

A busy week with more performance gains than regressions. These changes included one very large [perf gain](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79670) and one very large [perf regression](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78407) in stress test benchmarks that seem to only produce mild perf changes in real world use cases.

Triage done by **@rylev**.

3 Regressions, 5 Improvements, 4 Mixed
2 of them in rollups

#### Regressions

Use tcx.symbol_name when determining clashing extern declarations. [#80009](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80009)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=704e47f78b4c8801a3c76f235a5a152e1b60b300&end=7a9b552cb1621c9c57898d147228aab32b65a7c3&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.3% on `incr-full` builds of `externs-check`)
- Fix for [overeager warning in clashing extern declarations](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79581).
- Unsure how much performance can be gained back but an allocation is occuring that isn't strictly necessary. Perhaps removing it will help.
- PR author was pinged about the regression [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80009#issuecomment-763526902)

Update cargo [#80974](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80974)

- Large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=18ec4a9a74731ddc6a453ca29c0836f61dbcb8d4&end=e48eb37b9470a26748c916f7153569906f3c67bf&stat=instructions:u) (up to 5.2% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `token-stream-stress-opt`)
- Purely an update of Cargo. Not sure why this is causing issues.

implement ptr::write without dedicated intrinsic [#80290](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80290)

- Small regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=63a83c5f55801b17b77adf690db397d17c706c48&end=492b83c6971c390af7a42932869502224ef55ef7&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.2% on `full` builds of `regex-debug`)
- Small regex-debug full builds regression specifically in the `LLVM_module_codegen_emit_obj` query. This largely affects debug builds due to this previously being an instrinsic but now requiring LLVM to optimize it to its previously efficient form.
- An idea for gaining the performance back can be found [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80290#issuecomment-763583590)

#### Improvements

- Turn type inhabitedness into a query to fix `exhaustive_patterns` perf [#79670](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79670)
- Reintroduce hir::ExprKind::If [#79328](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79328)
- Use probe-stack=inline-asm in LLVM 11+ [#77885](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77885)
- Try to avoid locals when cloning into Box/Rc/Arc [#80824](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80824)
- BTreeMap: convert search functions to methods [#81159](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81159)

#### Mixed

- Make CTFE able to check for UB... [#78407](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78407)
- Rollup of 10 pull requests [#80960](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80960)
- Rollup of 13 pull requests [#81113](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81113)
- Remove PredicateKind and instead only use Binder<PredicateAtom> [#80679](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80679)

#### Nags requiring follow up

- Still need a follow up to one of last weeks [perf regressions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80441)
