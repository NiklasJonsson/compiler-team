### WG checkins

@_T-compiler/WG-meta_ checkin by @**nikomatsakis**:

> Checkin text

@_WG-mir-opt_ checkin by @**oli**:

> - `-Zmir-opt-level`'s meaning gets refactored to stop including buggy opts (https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/319)
> - harden const propagator against regressions and bugs (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73693, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73613)
> - MIR overflow messages now contain the binop arguments that caused the overflow (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73513)
>   - only used in the const evaluator and const propagator, but we can make runtime asserts also do this (similar to how index out of bounds displays length and index)
> - MIR printing can now print variant-less enums (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73442)
> - MIR is now checked to make sure its invariants are upheld (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72796, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72093)
>
> Not sure if we already had this last time, but even if, this is worth repeating: [we have a totally awesome NRVO pass!](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72205)

## Performance logs

[Triage done by njn](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/tree/master/triage#triage-logs)

This week was a disaster, perf-wise. 28 revisions checked. 7 regressions, several of them ranging from large to huge, many in rollups. Some additional regressions may have occurred in rollups that were masked by other regressions/improvements. 3 improvements, one of which was a reversion of a regression. Thanks for Mark-Simulacrum and eddyb for follow-up measurements and adding new tooling to help investigate regressions in rollups. A follow-up thread on Zulip is [here](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/247081-t-compiler.2Fperformance/topic/Follow-up.20to.20the.20bad.20perf.20triage.20of.202020-07-21).

In better news, rustdoc performance is now being benchmarked, thanks to the
efforts of [Joshua Nelson](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/675).

Triage done by njn. Revision range: [9d09331e00b02f81c714b0c41ce3a38380dd36a2..71384101ea3b030b80f7def80a37f67e148518b0](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=9d09331e00b02f81c714b0c41ce3a38380dd36a2&end=71384101ea3b030b80f7def80a37f67e148518b0&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au).

  Up to 6.4% losses on rustdoc for two benchmarks.

Improvements

- [Rollup of 7 pull requests #74493](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74493#issuecomment-661521298)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=1fa54ad9680cc82e7301f8ed4e9b7402dfd6ce0e&end=0701419e96d94e5493c7ebfcecb66511ab0aa778&stat=instructions:u)):
  Up to 33.5% improvements, at least partly due to the backout of
  [#74416](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74416) in
  [#74478](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74478), but it's also
  possible that another PR in that rollup [caused a regression that was masked
  by the improvement from the backout](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74493#issuecomment-661521298).
- [Change `SymbolName::name` to a `&str`. #74214](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74214#issuecomment-661459141)

  Up to 2.5% wins on numerous benchmarks.
- [Don't run `everybody_loops` for rustdoc; instead ignore resolution errors #73566](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73566#issuecomment-661484787)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=6ee1b62c811a6eb68d6db6dfb91f66a49956749b&end=5c9e5df3a097e094641f16dab501ab1c4da10e9f&stat=instructions:u)):
  Wins of up to 62.6% and losses of up to 8.5%, all on rustdoc builds. Overall,
  the improvements greatly outweigh the losses. (Landed in rollup
  [#74408](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74408).)

### Notes

[Rollup of 11 pull requests #74468](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74468#issuecomment-661371815)

- ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=d3df8512d2c2afc6d2e7d8b5b951dd7f2ad77b02-v1&end=7d31ffc1ac9e9ea356e896e63307168a64501b9d&stat=instructions:u))

This rollup was originally judged as responsible for a 10% regression in
instrutions:u. However, since then, it has been determined that the likely cause of this regression is actually perf's [move](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/commit/048360c77a74244ba6e70d9b3f2bcd7779b8129f) to using `x.py dist`-shipped std's rather than building one locally. Investigation into _why_ this move caused a regression is as yet not done, but is being tracked in [rustc-perf#724](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/724).

Initially [#74069](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74069) and/or [#72414](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72414) were suspected as the cause of the regression, but further testing showed that to not be the case.

- The original rollup, #74468, landed with a [5-10% performance regression](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=d3df8512d2c2afc6d2e7d8b5b951dd7f2ad77b02-v1&end=7d31ffc1ac9e9ea356e896e63307168a64501b9d&stat=instructions:u)
- In #74611, we tested as-if a rollup of #74069 and #72414 landed. ([This](https://gist.github.com/Mark-Simulacrum/6893dff239d116947bca647f4f8128c7) is the diff between d3df85 and cfade73) That yielded [identical results to the rollup](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=d3df8512d2c2afc6d2e7d8b5b951dd7f2ad77b02-v1&end=cfade73820883adf654fe34fd6b0b03a99458a51).
- We reverted #74069 in #74611, this yielded [neutral performance results](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=e8b55a4ad230ebec762fdfc4f241ba98a98560af&end=fcac11993ca055bbdc7683a2f6ed7b88a838fb0f&stat=instructions:u).
- #74716 then tried a revert of #72414 but this also yielded [neutral performance results](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=900869371e13cead086f4f9809419daa6a63cfaf&end=193b2f77c9463ed7378c20bad843a9031489e215)

We have since opened a PR to re-land #74069, as well: #74802.
