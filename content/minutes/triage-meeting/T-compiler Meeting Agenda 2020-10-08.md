## Beta-nominations

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Abeta-nominated+-label%3Abeta-accepted+label%3AT-compiler)

- "Move `EarlyOtherwiseBranch` to mir-opt-level 2" [rust#77582](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77582)
  - Opened by @**ecstatic-morse** and assigned to @**Wesley Wiser**
  - References [PR #75119](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75119)
- "Update RLS and Rustfmt" [rust#77590](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77590)
  - Nominated because the rustfmt bump includes support for some syntax that is newly introduced in 1.48.0. When adding syntax we should aim for the rustfmt which ships with the same version of rustc to not fail on the new syntax.

## Performance logs

A quiet week. One rather large regression on a synthetic benchmark and a few
small improvements.

[#77023](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77023) is an interesting
case. It encoded an invariant about slice lengths as an `assume` intrinsic
inside `len` function. It seems to have caused a small compile-time slowdown,
but there was no improvement in `check` build performance (a proxy for generated
code quality). In fact, the LLVM documentation [specifically advises
against](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#llvm-assume-intrinsic) overuse of
the `assume` intrinsic in cases where the invariant is unlikely to be of much
help to the optimizer. That seems to be the case here.

Triage done by **@ecstaticmorse**.

## Nominated Issues

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-compiler)

- "`use dep1::foo as dep1` is considered ambiguous on nightly but not beta" [rust#77586](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77586)
  - @**Vadim Petrochenkov** explains that the reason of this regression is [rust#77421](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77421) that addresses [rust#74556](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74556) which is not [a bug fix, but rather an implementation of a slightly more conservative language rule giving us some more freedom in the future](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77586#issuecomment-703812974).
  - Reporter mentions that [fixing to code to make it compile](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77586#issuecomment-703817449) is not a big deal
  - We're slighty inclined to either close it or maybe run craterbot over it

[libs-impl](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-nominated+label%3Alibs-impl)

- "regression 1.46 -> 1.47 big-endian backtrace-related UI tests failing" [rust#77410](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77410)
  - Looks like there's a regression on Tier 2 platforms: `s390x | powerpc | ppc64 | sparc64` but OK on 1.46: `s390x | ppc64`
  - Could be related to PR [rust#74682](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74682) and [rust#77424](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77424)
