### WG checkins

@_WG-diagnostics_ checkin by @**Esteban Küber**

> - More gracefully handle patterns used in an incorrect manner (all combinations of struct variant/enum variant/unit variant that do not correspond to their declaration) with structured suggestions and pointing at definitions
> - From fasterthanli.me (amos)'s last two articles we've gotten 3 diagnostics improvements
>   cleaning up parser errors (regression from a refactor some time back, reduced amount of parse errors inside struct definitions significantly)

    - structured suggestions for methods missing `self` receiver
    - more structured suggestions for boxed trait objects instead of impl Trait on non-coerceable tail expressions

> - Fix parser regression: `{block} &&true` is a valid tail expression in an `fn foo() -> &&bool`. This was introduced a couple of releases back, will be fixed in 1.47.
> - We detect `===/!==` and `for foo of bar` (JS syntax) and suggest correct syntax
> - Various clean ups, rewordings, fixing of ICEs and silencing of redundant errors
> - Further various cleanups of `::` -> `:` typos (continue to hate the type ascription syntax, but I'll cope)
> - Removal of type path string comparisons from diagnostics code and instead use "diagnostic_item"s.
> - Further work on lifetime errors caused by implicit`'static` lifetimes with targeted diagnostics
> - Tweak errors on arguments caused by Sized requirements and suggest to borrow
> - Detect `foo.collect::Vec<_>();` and suggest `foo.collect::<Vec<_>>();`
> - Provide suggestions for some moved value errors
>
> Changes requiring to be signed off (or closed)
>
> - [rust#74130](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74130)
> - [rust#71481](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71481)
>
> Feeling fancy and wanting to highlight still unmerged change that I'm proud of:
>
> - [rust#75931](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75931) Suggest `if let x = y` when encountering `if x = y`
>
> Kind of major change announcement:
>
> - [rust#75138](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75138) moves a lot of the error handling logic "out of the happy path"
>   by using structs to describe the error situation and having a scheme for rendering said structs.

@_WG-async-foundations_ checkin by @**nikomatsakis** and @**tmandry**

> Work on the compiler has, I believe, been slow lately. There has been progress towards an RFC for the `Stream` trait and experiments for a lint around values that should be live over yields. -- nikomatsakis, who may be a bit behindCheckin text

  - It seems to be caused by [rust#72746](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72746) by @**tmandry**
  - Seems to be specific to QEMU, [see comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74820#issuecomment-673977399)
- "diagnostics: "one type is more general" for two identical types?" [rust#75791](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75791)

  - Regressed on [rust#73643](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73643) which is a rollup, likely to be [rust#72493](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72493)

## Performance logs

This week saw an upgrade to LLVM 11, which resulted in large speedups to
optimized builds. This offsets the slowdown we observed as part of the [upgrade
to LLVM 10][llvm-10-results]. Many thanks to rust-lang and LLVM contributor
[@nikic](https://github.com/nikic) for their work to measure [LLVM
performance][llvm-fast]. That upgrade did cause slight regressions to check and
debug builds, but on the whole it is a significant win for compile times.
