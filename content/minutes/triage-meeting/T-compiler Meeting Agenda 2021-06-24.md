### P-high regressions

[P-high beta regressions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aregression-from-stable-to-beta+label%3AP-high+-label%3AT-infra+-label%3AT-libs+-label%3AT-release+-label%3AT-rustdoc+-label%3AT-core)

- No `P-high` beta regressions this time.

[Unassigned P-high nightly regressions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aregression-from-stable-to-nightly+label%3AP-high+no%3Aassignee+-label%3AT-infra+-label%3AT-libs+-label%3AT-release+-label%3AT-rustdoc+-label%3AT-core)

- "Apple platforms: Disabled frame pointer elimination causes perf issues and is not in line with what clang does" [rust#86196](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86196)
  - opened by @**Hans Kratz**
  - [mild perf regression](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86196#issuecomment-860443448) on target Apple with disabled frame pointer elimination (clang default on macOS: `frame-pointer="no-leaf""`, in Rust nightly became `frame-pointer="all"`) along with an increase in binary size
  - needs an owner but not so a pressing issue (see [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86196#issuecomment-860443448): "while using `"frame-pointer"="non-leaf"` on Macos is generally a good idea since it has the potential to affect performance in rare cases it is not as urgent.")

## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2021-06-23](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/tree/master/triage#triage-logs)

A few small regressions on smaller benchmarks (e.g., helloworld), likely centered around more IR being generated in a few cases.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**. 2 Regressions, 1 Improvements, 0 Mixed, 1 of them in rollups

#### Regressions

Rollup of 6 pull requests [#86417](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86417)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=149f4836dd6d9e789a26dca16dc034588866894e&end=a6bc43ea846ee568ef4e890d4ac2a4cc03475bfc&stat=instructions:u) (up to 2.0% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `helloworld-opt`)
- Not really clear what the cause here is, but the regression is concentrated on
  small benchmarks.

Change entry point to 🛡️ against 💥 💥-payloads [#86034](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86034)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=29cd70d40722930e66a8b726fe58a7bd1d64a22b&end=6b354a13820a444f834a33365ae4a8d97d7d27ce&stat=instructions:u) (up to 4.5% on `incr-full` builds of `helloworld-opt`)
- Seems to be more code getting generated into binaries, leading to
  regressions on the smaller benchmarks.

#### Improvements

- optimize Eq implementation for paths [#86179](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86179)

#### Nags requiring follow up

Backlog:

- Follow up on regression in [#85343](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/85343#issuecomment-856819536)
