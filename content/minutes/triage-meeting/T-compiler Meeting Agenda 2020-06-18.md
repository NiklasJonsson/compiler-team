### WG checkins

@_WG-prioritization_ checkin by @**spastorino**:

> - We are now executing our process fully async and have bi-weekly planning/steering meetings to think about things to improve.
> - We've prioritized all `I-unsound ðŸ’¥` issues for `T-compiler` and `libs-impl`.
> - From now on, new issues tagged with `I-unsound ðŸ’¥` will automatically add `I-prioritize` and then request prioritization to the wg.
> - There are not unprioritized regressions anymore :tada:
> - We've prioritized all `regression-from-stable-to-stable` issues for `T-compiler` and `libs-impl`.
> - From now on new issues tagged with `regression-from-stable-to-stable` will automatically add `I-prioritize` and then request prioritization to the wg.
> - Same happens for `regression-from-stable-to-beta` and `regression-from-stable-to-nightly`.
> - We are in the process of automating most of our procedure.

@_WG-rfc-2229_ checkin by @**nikomatsakis**:

> - We've created a repository to track the issues and work, [rust-lang/project-rfc-2229](https://github.com/rust-lang/project-rfc-2229)
> - Currently doing some core refactorings, improving the "HIR place" datastructure to /IU be sufficiently precise, and refactoring how closures represent captures to use that instead of individual variables

  - It's beta nominated
- "ICE: could not fully normalize" [#73249](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73249)

## Performance logs

[Triage done by njn](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/tree/master/triage#triage-logs)

Some bustage involving Cargo meant that some merges in this period didn't get measured.

Regressions:

- [Rollup of 10 pull requests](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73367#issuecomment-644456094) ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=ce6d3a73b514e9649e57cee812ad129bb2112016&end=d4ecf31efc2309fb6df8c2a8af9aaf8176ab1c8d&stat=instructions:u)):
  Regressed up to 3.5% on multiple benchmarks. Maybe [#71824](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71824) is the cause?
- [Disable the `SimplifyArmIdentity` pass](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73262#issuecomment-644451010) ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=7c78a5f97de07a185eebae5a5de436c80d8ba9d4&end=f4fbb93113aa4f0a0cd08e74afb35381bbfbc7f0&stat=instructions:u)):
  A small regression on a couple of benchmarks from disabling a buggy pass,
  which may be re-enabled in the future?
- A small regression occurred for `syn-opt`, but I can't tell which PR was
  responsible because the improvement occurred in one of the merges that wasn't
  measured due to the Cargo bustage.

Improvements:

- Some huge improvements occurred for `clap-rs-opt`, but I can't tell which PR was responsible because the improvement occurred in one of the merges that wasn't measured due to the Cargo bustage.
- [Rollup of 8 pull requests](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73316#issuecomment-644453724) ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=1fb612bd15bb3ef098fd24c20d0727de573b4410&end=06e47688bf15d0215edbe05b21603062f6d2eb5d&stat=instructions:u)):
  A small improvement on `many-assoc-items`, and a tiny regression on a couple of other benchmarks.
