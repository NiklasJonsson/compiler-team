### WG checkins

@_WG-self-profile_ by @**mw** @**Wesley Wiser** ([previous checkin](https://hackmd.io/tuLB5d6ETKCZGS3cpzzRiA#WG-checkins))

> @rylev and @**mw** are slowly working towards being able to record non-timestamp data like the sizes of files that the compiler emits -- e.g. object files and incr. comp. on-disk data. @**Wesley Wiser** is doing the reviewing. We should have something to show by the next checkin :)

## Backport nominations

[T-compiler stable](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Abeta-nominated+-label%3Abeta-accepted+label%3AT-compiler) / [T-compiler beta](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Astable-nominated+-label%3Astable-accepted+label%3AT-compiler)

- :beta: "Always preserve sub-obligations in the projection cache" [rust#85868](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/85868)
  - @**pnkfelix** self-assigned to find another reviewer
  - feedback from @Jack Huey on it to @Aaron Hill. But Jack also said they would not be comfortable reviewing without at least some support from e.g. @nikomatsakis (perhaps during one of Niko's office times)
- No stable nominations for `T-compiler` this time.

[T-rustdoc stable](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Abeta-nominated+-label%3Abeta-accepted+label%3AT-rustdoc) / [T-rustdoc beta](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Astable-nominated+-label%3Astable-accepted+label%3AT-rustdoc)

## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2021-08-17](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-08-17.md)

A fairly busy week which was to expected given that we've [adjusted our algorithm](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/956) for whether we label a change as a regression or not. Most regressions were relatively small, and only one has not yet been addressed in some way.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [6b20506d17f4e5e5bf5bcad7e94add4d754b0ae3..aa8f27bf4d980023a8b245ceb25a490a18041eb2](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=6b20506d17f4e5e5bf5bcad7e94add4d754b0ae3&end=aa8f27bf4d980023a8b245ceb25a490a18041eb2&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)
59 comparisons made in total

3 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 2 Mixed; 0 of them in rollups

#### Regressions

encode `generics_of` for fields and ty params [#87815](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87815)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=2d10c2a3302d53e10a4ad3ac581103faaae9eeb6&end=c4c2986c499ee9440b7ae23bf5a62c6168e1ce17&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.2% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `diesel`)
- While the regressions are fairly small, the largest ones seem to be happening in real-world crates like diesel, serde, and futures.
- The largest regressions seem to be in the `explicit_predicates_of` query which would seem to be directly impacted by this change.
- Left a [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87815#issuecomment-900465263) to see how we should address this issue.

Various refactorings of the TAIT infrastructure [#87587](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87587)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=47b41b7788a6f85c749049062f1e4eed497cd894&end=d488de82f30fd1dcb0220d57498638596622394e&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.5% on `full` builds of `inflate`)
- The issue is [expected](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87587#issuecomment-896754235) and is being monitored with a possible solution in the works.

Name the captured upvars for closures/generators in debuginfo [#85020](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85020)

- Large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=c6094fc7b9981d755abeb8c0e866a0f6315b3ec3&end=99efc51dae1dbe9d741707a7ddef84c29e654df5&stat=instructions:u) (up to 4.9% on `incr-patched: println` builds of `webrender-wrench`)
- This is a large regression in one benchmark, but it seems to be in codegen which this change would impact.
- [There is a comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/85020#issuecomment-898823772) justifying this as concerning but worth it given it only impacts one benchmark. I still believe this might be one worth keeping an eye on.

#### Improvements

- Avoid using the `copy_nonoverlapping` wrapper through `mem::replace`. [#87827](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87827)
- Run RemoveZsts pass at mir-opt-level=1 [#83417](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83417)

#### Mixed

Introduce `hir::ExprKind::Let` - Take 2 [#80357](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80357)

- Large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=2bd17c1d43bba43412cc2f051323a279d6751e43&end=2a6fb9a4c0e5ca7a81999065943b211c226fe9d8&stat=instructions:u) (up to -2.1% on `incr-patched: println` builds of `webrender`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=2bd17c1d43bba43412cc2f051323a279d6751e43&end=2a6fb9a4c0e5ca7a81999065943b211c226fe9d8&stat=instructions:u) (up to 0.7% on `full` builds of `cranelift-codegen`)

BTree: merge the complication introduced by #81486 and #86031 [#87696](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87696)

- Small improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=2a6fb9a4c0e5ca7a81999065943b211c226fe9d8&end=23461b210f1b0a121592a18fc4fb666106006668&stat=instructions:u) (up to -0.6% on `full` builds of `issue-46449`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=2a6fb9a4c0e5ca7a81999065943b211c226fe9d8&end=23461b210f1b0a121592a18fc4fb666106006668&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.7% on `full` builds of `ripgrep`)
- This is mostly a wash in terms of performance (with performance shifting somewhat equally across all the benchmarks), with the largest changes happening in stress tests.

  - still needs discussion or `I-nominated` can be removed?
