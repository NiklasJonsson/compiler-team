### WG checkins

@_WG-polonius_ checkin by @**nikomatsakis** and @**lqd**:

> We are planning a "sprint" Aug 3 - 5, which means that we'll be putting some energy into pushing polonius along. We've been changing to this "sprint-oriented" model because it's hard to keep a complex project like polonius moving in fits and starts, it requires some dedicated attention.
>
> Last sprint we focused on getting a "complete write-up" of the polonius rules and in particular incorporating liveness and other things. I'm not sure what we'll focus on this sprint, probably similar themes, but I know that lqd has some ideas. --nikomatsakis

WG-Polymorphization checkin by @**davidtwco**:

> Since the last check-in from the polymorphisation working group (myself with lots of help from @_**eddyb** and @_**lcnr**), we’ve made a few steps forward and a few steps back:
>
> Polymorphisation (#69749) was merged and enabled by default. Another perf run was performed before merge, which found that the improvements from earlier perf runs had vanished - some investigation revealed that this was due to an update to the script-servo benchmark that patched the opportunity that polymorphisation was taking advantage of.
>
> We quickly discovered a regression that was missed by the test suite in #74614. Some investigation revealed the issue but we fixed the issue by disabling polymorphisation again in #74633. #74636 was filed to track fixing the underlying bug - there are some subtle implications of polymorphisation here that we hadn’t thought about and warrant some discussion.
>
> #74717 has been submitted to fix that regression, but it’s still pending review and warrants some discussion before merge (particularly with respect to the intersection between polymorphisation and reflection).
>
> @\_**lcnr** fixed another bug with polymorphisation that was discovered while investigating the regression with #74623.
>
> @\_**njn** reported that disabling polymorphisation didn’t regain the performance losses of enabling it - I intend to look into why this might be soon.

## Performance logs

We need to first re-discuss [last week's performance report](https://hackmd.io/jK5Cm8QJSGG7ukq7lVilLg?view#Performance-logs) because during last meeting we didn't have time for that.

This week's performance report ...

Triage done by njn. Revision range: [71384101ea3b030b80f7def80a37f67e148518b0..efc02b03d18b0cbaa55b1e421d792f70a39230b2](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=71384101ea3b030b80f7def80a37f67e148518b0&end=efc02b03d18b0cbaa55b1e421d792f70a39230b2&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

2 regressions, 1 improvement, none of them on rollups.

Regressions

- [Serialize span hygiene data #72121](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72121#issuecomment-664685450)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=c70986264b4d534e35992fc64ecd9139700b5071&end=fa36f960687c41caf5b260ab7610ebd83a7860dd&stat=instructions:u)):
  Up to 3.5% losses on numerous benchmarks. This was expected, and the author and reviewer deemed it reasonable for the improvement in error messages.
- [Polymorphization #69749](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/69749#issuecomment-664688297)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=734233d29771869f824d8ddbaddabb90b3b68e03&end=b52522ade1f6979a35b24087dadcf5ba5c981cbe&stat=instructions:u)):
  Up to 1.8% losses (ignoring the noisy `script-servo-2-opt` results), which was expected. (Hopefully extensions to this change will allow for compile time improvements in the future.) This feature was later disabled due to correctness issues, but the disabling was [performance neutral](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74633#issuecomment-664691511), oddly enough.

Improvements

- [Revert libbacktrace -> gimli #74613](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74613#issuecomment-664682974)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=2bbfa02b1b15974d5772b520aa027bf79f8c248e&end=371917ab218de72a625227ba6eed7e84e610a058&stat=instructions:u)):
  Up to 25.5% wins across many benchmarks. A reversion of one of last week's regressions. This PR may re-land because it's a big functional improvement and the regressions are mostly on very short-running benchmarks. If it does it will be after consideration and with intention.
