### WG checkins

- @_WG-diagnostics_ by @**Esteban KÃ¼ber** and @**oli** ([previous checkin](https://hackmd.io/3r_D-3ElQ-WR_VVzx4g2Pw?view#WG-checkins)):

> - Trait Alias = impl Trait; improvements
> - NLL borrowck closer in parity with old borrowck
> - Typo suggestions in more places (assoc items and modules/crates)
> - Multiple improvements around trait bound presentation
> - More accurate expected/found labels when trait paths are the same (long standing confusing issue)
> - **I** now consider type ascription syntax as no longer being problematic (last outstanding issues for common confusables closed)
> - Internal refactors & general clean ups
> - More parser recovery for common typos in match arms
> - Extend C-style printf format string parsing ðŸ˜…
>
> There's in flight a style linter for diagnostics, to ensure consistency, which even without merging has already yielded a few clean up PRs

## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2021-10-12](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-10-12.md)

A relatively quiet week: two smallish regressions, and one largish regression that is isolated to doc builds. A couple of nice small wins as well.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [25ec8273855fde2d72ae877b397e054de5300e10..9475e609b8458fff9e444934a6017d2e590642cf](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=25ec8273855fde2d72ae877b397e054de5300e10&end=9475e609b8458fff9e444934a6017d2e590642cf&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)
