## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2021-08-25](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-08-24.md)

A few regressions but largely an improvement this week, mostly due to the upgrade to LLVM 13.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**. 2 Regressions, 1 Improvements, 2 Mixed; 0 of them in rollups

#### Regressions

Update the backtrace crate in libstd [#88151](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88151)

- Large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=2451f42c1deb9379d5e8e5fa86b0bf857ae048ec&end=7960030d6915a771f5ab72c3897a7ed50c3ed4bd&stat=instructions:u) (up to 2.6% on `incr-patched: u8 3072` builds of `issue-46449`)
- Standard regression from an increase in std/core size due to added items.

Add fast path for Path::cmp that skips over long shared prefixes [#86898](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86898)

- Small improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=7611fe438dae91084d17022e705bf64374d5ba4b&end=bcfd3f7e88084850f87b8e34b4dcb9fceb872d00&stat=instructions:u) (up to -0.3% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `helloworld`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=7611fe438dae91084d17022e705bf64374d5ba4b&end=bcfd3f7e88084850f87b8e34b4dcb9fceb872d00&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.2% on `incr-patched: println` builds of `ripgrep`)
- Largely in -doc builds, seems to be a small but real regression.

#### Improvements

- Reenable RemoveZsts [#88176](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88176)

#### Mixed

Revert "Auto merge of #83417 - erikdesjardins:enableremovezsts, r=oli-obk" [#88056](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88056)

- Small improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=aa8f27bf4d980023a8b245ceb25a490a18041eb2&end=806b3995b8f622d5de10afcc11c10a028a7b876a&stat=instructions:u) (up to -0.5% on `incr-patched: println` builds of `cargo`)
- Large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=aa8f27bf4d980023a8b245ceb25a490a18041eb2&end=806b3995b8f622d5de10afcc11c10a028a7b876a&stat=instructions:u) (up to 4.5% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `deeply-nested-async`)
- Regression is canceled out by the later #88176 (see improvements above).
  Upgrade to LLVM 13 [#87570](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87570)
- Very large improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=e7f7fe462a54b1caeb804a974cd43ba9fd7bee5c&end=db002a06ae9154a35d410550bc5132df883d7baa&stat=instructions:u) (up to -10.4% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `helloworld`)
- Very large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=e7f7fe462a54b1caeb804a974cd43ba9fd7bee5c&end=db002a06ae9154a35d410550bc5132df883d7baa&stat=instructions:u) (up to 9.6% on `full` builds of `match-stress-enum`)
- Overall an improvement, regressions are significantly more limited to just a
  few cases compared to the improvements seen across the board.
