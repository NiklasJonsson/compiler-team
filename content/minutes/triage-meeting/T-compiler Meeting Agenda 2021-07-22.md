### WG checkins

@_WG-diagnostics_ from @**Esteban KÃ¼ber** and @**oli**

> Since our last checking a lot of PRs with improvements have been merged. We've made many subtle changes to wording, amount and accuracy of information and presence structured suggestions in a variety of diagnostics. All of them fall into one of the following categories:
>
> - More accurate spans for predicate obligations (associated types and trait bounds, ongoing area of concern)
> - We now account better for implicit `'static` lifetimes introduced by type params and assoc types
> - We now include `for<'lt>` in pretty printing output
> - We had some efforts to close the distance between nll and old regionck output
> - Improvements to MIR, TAIT and const diagnostics, as part of ongoing efforts
> - Tweaks to lint triggering and output
> - We now include first macro level, this particularly makes errors involving `derive` macros easier to understand
> - Various parser and error recovery improvements
> - Various ICE fixes by improving support or use of `delay_span_bug`
> - Proc macros can now have spans pointing _to their own crate_
> - `#[track_caller]` now works on trait object method calls
> - Point at `impl Trait` return types in more cases
> - Multiple regression tests added
>
> I want to call out @FabianWolff, @Aaron1011 and @Smittyvb for delivering on a number of these categories.
>
> ---
>
> Not directly related to WG-diagnostics, but I want to call it out:
>
> > [Eisel-Lemire algorithm Float-Parsing Algorithm #86761](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/86761) landed on nightly, removing a now unnecessary error.

## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2021-07-20](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-07-20.md)

A mixed week, with some moderate regressions and moderate improvements. (I am personally wondering whether style-servo-debug needs to have a larger individual threshold for signalling a regression.) There were some notable PR's that were specifically oriented around performance enhancements.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [5aff6dd07a562a2cba3c57fc3460a72acb6bef46..5c0ca08c662399c1c864310d1a20867d3ab68027](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=5aff6dd07a562a2cba3c57fc3460a72acb6bef46&end=5c0ca08c662399c1c864310d1a20867d3ab68027&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

3 Regressions, 3 Improvements, 3 Mixed; 1 of them in rollups

#### Regressions

Replace associated item bound vars with placeholders when projecting [#86993](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86993)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=b1f8e27b74c541d3d555149c8efa4bfe9385cd56&end=27e42058811e448b1a7dd8630d86ab247fbfcb9b&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.5% on `incr-patched: b9b3e592dd cherry picked` builds of `style-servo-debug`)
- A perf run was [done on the PR originally](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=fdfe819580062a441024d713b49340cd3f7d7efc&end=7baa78ec683fd14db4d4c1869dbef5cbbc5b774d). The regression flagged here seems to be on a different set of benchmarks: `style-servo-debug` and `wf-projection-stress-65510-*`, neither of which was flagged as a regression in the original runs.
- Results overall seem pretty mixed and hard to interpret. Left a [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/86993#issuecomment-883624762) on the PR.

Remove special case for `ExprKind::Paren` in `MutVisitor` [#87284](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87284)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=014026d1a7ca991f82f12efa95ef4dffb29dc8af&end=6535449a002264ee08dec8e741f1aadd97428fae&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.0% on `full` builds of `coercions-debug`)
- This is on the borderline for "significant regression", and was the _only_ regression associated with this PR.
- Also, `coercions-debug` seems like it has a noisy history (that's pnkfelix's opinion from eyeballing it; it has also a single "?" on its comparison line.)

Better diagnostics with mismatched types due to implicit static lifetime [#87244](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87244)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=718d53b0cb7dde93499cb92950d60b412f5a3d05&end=da7d405357600a76f2b93b8aa41fe5ee5da7885d&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.2% on `full` builds of `stm32f4-check`)
- Widespread regressions that exceed the 0.2% threshold for non-noisy benchmarks.
- Left a [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87244#issuecomment-883635813) asking if this was expected. But I suspect the situation does not warrant additional investment of effort, assuming there's no trivial fix identifiable from the PR author.

#### Improvements

- Rollup of 6 pull requests [#87118](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87118)
- Make expansions stable for incr. comp. [#86676](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86676)
- Some perf optimizations and logging [#87203](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87203)

#### Mixed

Cache expansion hash globally [#87044](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87044)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=3e1c75c6e25a4db968066bd2ef2dabc7c504d7ca&end=c7d6bcc788ef6b2293d2d5166a9b0339d5d03b0a&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.9% on `full` builds of `deeply-nested-async-check`)
- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=3e1c75c6e25a4db968066bd2ef2dabc7c504d7ca&end=c7d6bcc788ef6b2293d2d5166a9b0339d5d03b0a&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.4% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `inflate-check`)
- This was an improvement for a lot of incremental cases, and a regression for a few full-compilation cases: `deeply-nested-async-{check,debug,opt}`, and `coercions-debug`.
- It seems like these results were [expected](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87044#issuecomment-879407381), and they make sense given the nature of the PR.

Update Rust Float-Parsing Algorithms to use the Eisel-Lemire algorithm. [#86761](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86761)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=64d171b8a419eb6cb872ab579398eff8a741bbc6&end=f502bd3abd12111bbfae0974db018c165a977c0e&stat=instructions:u) (up to 3.2% on `incr-patched: b9b3e592dd cherry picked` builds of `style-servo-debug`)
- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=64d171b8a419eb6cb872ab579398eff8a741bbc6&end=f502bd3abd12111bbfae0974db018c165a977c0e&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.4% on `full` builds of `piston-image-opt`)
- A perf run was done on the orignal PR, but the run there did not predict the regression that was now observed to `style-servo-debug` when this PR landed on nightly.
- Left a [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/86761#issuecomment-883645181), but I am guessing that `style-servo-debug` may need a bigger noise threshold (or rather, sensitivity to perturbations) than what we currently use.

Move OnDiskCache to rustc_query_impl. [#86698](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86698)

- Moderate improvement in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=5a8a44196b3cf099f8c9b0156bd902eaec0b4e5f&end=18073052d8c3544ccb73effd289ed3acda0d66c0&stat=instructions:u) (up to -1.4% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `ctfe-stress-4-check`)
- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=5a8a44196b3cf099f8c9b0156bd902eaec0b4e5f&end=18073052d8c3544ccb73effd289ed3acda0d66c0&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.1% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `deeply-nested-async-opt`)
- A perf run was done on the original PR that predicted a much better outcome here.
- Left a [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/86698#issuecomment-883647259) asking PR author if they have any idea about the discrepancy.
