### WG checkins

- @_WG-rls2.0_ checkin by @**matklad**
  > - Conveniently, we just finished a six-week sprint
      * old sprint: https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/7838
      * new sprint: https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/8486
  > - We now support derive and function-like proc macros by default
  > - Supprot for attribute proc-macros is the last big bit until we have "feature parity" with rustc (
  >   well, was before min-const-generics were stabilized :-)
  > - We switched to chalk's representation on types!
  > - We significantly reduced memory usage of rust-analyzer (finally!)

> Overall, there's a feeling that rust-analyzer becomes less and less experimental, and more a dependable piece of Rust tooling. So, we want to focus on quality next: fixing glaring bugs, tidying up the internals, and, hopefully, moving forward with [RFC 2912](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2912-rust-analyzer.md).

> Sadly, there's still not much concrete progress on sharing more code between rustc and rust-analyzer, besides the chalk work.

- @_WG-self-profile_ checkin by @**Wesley Wiser** and `michaelwoerister`
  > The working group has been quiet recently. Nothing to report.

## Backport nominations

[T-compiler stable](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Abeta-nominated+-label%3Abeta-accepted+label%3AT-compiler) / [T-compiler beta](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Astable-nominated+-label%3Astable-accepted+label%3AT-compiler)

- :beta: "move new c abi abort behavior behind feature gate" [rust#84158](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/84158)
  - pnkfelix nominated. They're not sure where the regression to beta is being tracked, if at all.
  - the discussion on #**t-release>`"C"` unwind issue for release 1.52** indicated that we would _either_ backport this fix (PR #84158), or we would revert PR #76570 on beta. That is the choice before us.

[T-libs-impl stable](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Abeta-nominated+-label%3Abeta-accepted+label%3AT-libs-impl) / [T-libs-impl beta](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Astable-nominated+-label%3Astable-accepted+label%3AT-libs-impl)

- No backport nominations for `T-libs-impl` this time.

[T-rustdoc stable](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Abeta-nominated+-label%3Abeta-accepted+label%3AT-rustdoc) / [T-rustdoc beta](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Astable-nominated+-label%3Astable-accepted+label%3AT-rustdoc)

- No backport nominations for `T-rustdoc` this time.

## Performance logs

> [2021-04-13 full triage logs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-04-13.md)

A very quiet week overall. Triage done by **@simulacrum**.

1 Regressions, 0 Improvements, 0 Mixed, 0 of them in rollups

#### Regressions

Update stdarch submodule (to before it switched to const generics) [#83776](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83776)

- Large regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=1284da34da56a17ae368e4673920ec4120562cbd&end=d0695c9081b16077d0aed368bccaf437d77ff497&stat=instructions:u) (up to 6.3% on `incr-unchanged` builds of `deeply-nested-closures-debug`)
- Mostly a regression for doc benchmarks, but also a 1.5% regression in memory
  usage on check, debug, and opt builds across all benchmarks.

#### Improvements

- None

#### Mixed

- None

#### Nags requiring follow up

- The [issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/82964#issuecomment-800663588) from three weeks ago has stalled.
  Likely this needs someone to mentor the author, or to take over the
  investigation.

## Nominated Issues

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-compiler)

  - (postponed from previous meetings)
- "no_std: binary size blowup using Result::unwrap since 1.49.0" [rustc#83925](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83925)
  - size of final binary exceeding the limit for deployment on an embedded tier2 platform (`thumbv7em-none-eabi`)
  - unsure how to treat this
- "Disk usage 2-3x somewhere around 1.48" [rustc##84097](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/84097)
  - Debian maintainer reports substancial increasing disk space when building rustc, across recent stable releases, build config is unchanged.
  - issue reporter mentions that possibly debuginfo-related - the architectures using the least space have `debuginfo-level = 0 `due to [#45854](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/45854), generally the 32-bit.
  - disk space metrics are not really measured on [perf.rlo](https://perf.rust-lang.org/dashboard.html)
  - unsure how to treat this class of issues involving disk space usage
