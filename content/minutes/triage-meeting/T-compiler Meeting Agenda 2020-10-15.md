### WG checkins

@_WG-async-foundations_ checkin by @**tmandry**:

> Most activity has been in RFCs and improving the async book lately. We've fixed some implementation issues lately and have a [large backlog](https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/projects/2) of others.
>
> There haven't been a ton of people picking up new issues to work on, but I'd still say the main bottlenecks have been reviews and mentoring. I'm shifting priorities to focus more time on this and would love to grow more reviewers from the people who are contributing. One (minor) challenge here is it's unclear if we want to grant r+ to individual wg members, but I think we do.

@_WG-diagnostics_ checkin by @**estebank**:

> As usual, there has been a flurry of unstructured activity, lots of small and medium sized improvements. The following are a loose cathegorization of some of the salient work since the last update, but I'm sure I'm missing some (mainly PRs I'm fogetting about that didn't close an existing A-diagnostics ticket)
>
> - **short path in error messages for unique identifiers** ðŸŽ‰
> - various improvements to structured suggestions for invalid patterns and invalid enum uses
> - various small fixes to I-perf, parser and span accuracy regressions
> - various borrowck wording and span tweaks
> - more turbofish misparse recovery and suggestions
> - gracefully handle range `const` used as pattern [rust#76222](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76222)
> - structured suggestion when finding trait where a type was expected in where clause and trait object type [rust#77087](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77087)
> - silence various redundant trait selection errors
> - detect turbofish without surrounding angle brackets and recover parser state gracefully
> - smarter numeric conversion suggestion [rust#73145](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73145)
> - suggest constraining type parameter with appropriate trait bound when encountering binop involving them
> - auditted hidden/short code suggestions
> - tweak "missing lifetime" structured suggestions to be more accurate and account for `for<'lt>`
>
> Upcoming change needing eyes:
>
> - Provide appropriate types in turbofish suggestions [rust#76043](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76043)

- "ICE: Expected module, found DefId" [rust#75982](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75982)
  - Unassigned
  - Reported by @**Daniel Henry-Mantilla|232018**
  - Issue priority raised to `P-high`: issue reporter [mentions there was a test shadowing the ICE](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75982#issuecomment-706100003) behind a compiler error. ICE persists after removing this test.

  - Build hangs on beta
  - @**Eric Huss** bisected it to [rust#73526](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73526)
  - @**cuviper** [is not aware of any LLVM 11 issue like that ](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76980#issuecomment-695805807)
  - A [possible workaround was added](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77642) by @**Pietro Albini** but it doesn't seem to be confirmation if works or not.
  - @**cuviper** believes the real issue stems in PR [rustc#74163](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74163)
  - There's a long technical analysis in the [last comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76980#issuecomment-705800997)

[Unassigned P-high nightly regressions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aregression-from-stable-to-nightly+label%3AP-high+no%3Aassignee)

- "New "warning incompatible with previous forbid in same scope" error" [rust#77713](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77713)
  - Opened by @**Nemo157**
  - Error seems two conflicting/overlapping `unused_extern_crates` linting options cause a crash
  - issue reporter mentions issue [rustc#77713](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70819) and following PR [rustc#77534](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77534) as origin of the intended behaviour
  - @**nikomatsakis** reported about the [discussion on this issues](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77713#issuecomment-707326546) and suggests to be ok with giving precedence to the `forbid` directive, provided a context of how the linting precedence used to work, works today and in different context (e.g. from the CLI)

## Performance logs

Overall, fairly busy week, but without major regressions that need to be
addressed.
