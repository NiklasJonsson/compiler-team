### WG checkins

@_WG-rls2.0_ checkin by @**matklad**

> rls-2.0 also have been pretty quiet lately.
> This means that there are a lot of improvements all over the place, but nothing particularly earth-shattering happened.
> We did ship on-the-fly (during completion) auto-imports.
> We are also in the process of yet-another redesign of the core syntax tree datastructure: https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/6857.
> The parser library-ification work is sadly on-hold :-[
> Finally, to re-invigorate more ambitious undertakings, we will now hold a rust-analyzer steering meeting every six weeks.
> The first one will happen next Monday, check the t-compiler calendar for details.

@_WG-self-profile_ checkin by @**Wesley Wiser**:

> WG activity was light this cycle:
>
> - @**andjo403** fixed a bug in the tooling where blocked queries weren't being properly counted when rustc was compiled with `parallel-compiler = true` ([measureme#148](https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme/pull/148))

  - not yet assigned
  - seems to affect specific s390x or to be related to endianess
  - @**Santiago Pastorino** [suggests testing again](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80810#issuecomment-758204892) against PR [#80732](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80732) (ready for review)

  - @**Matthew Jasper** mentions that pr #78373 [is possibly leading to a less precise borrowcheck](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80949#issuecomment-760019484) on how long the borrow lasts

## Performance logs

[2021-01-12 Triage full report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-01-12.md)

Overall, a positive albeit quiet week. The largest change came from the incremental compilation working group which delivered large gains in performance caused by [changes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76896) in how inlining is handled in debug mode. Unfortunately, these changes may be reversed due to concerns.

Triage done by **@rylev**.

1 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 3 Mixed 2 of them in rollups

#### Regressions

Rollup of 9 pull requests [#80867](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80867)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=7a193921a024e910262ff90bfb028074fddf20d0&end=34628e5b533d35840b61c5db0665cf7633ed3c5a&stat=instructions:u) (up to 1.7% on `incr-full` builds of `syn-opt`)
- Minor regressions in mostly incremental builds (both opt and debug).
- It's hard to tell which PR was responsible but [#79968](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79968/) seems to be the most likely. We will investigate.
- There was a change in the `impl_trait_ref` which may give hints as to the root cause.

#### Improvements

- Rollup of 9 pull requests [#80928](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80928)
- Do not query the HIR directly in `opt_associated_item`. [#80889](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80889)

#### Mixed

- Do not make local copies of inline fns in debug mode [#76896](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76896)
- ast: Remove some indirection layers from values in key-value attributes [#80441](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80441)
- Serialize incr comp structures to file via fixed-size buffer [#80463](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80463)

#### Nags requiring follow up

- Follow up needs to happen on the regressions, especially on the rollup [#80928](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80928) and [#80441](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80441) where the performance regressed from an early perf run done while the PR was still open.
