### WG checkins

Polymorphization working group checkin by @**davidtwco** @**eddyb** @**lcnr**

> I think the initial goal ought to be getting polymorphization enabled by default:
>
> - #75185 was opened to perform a crater run on polymorphization enabled-by-default. This was rebased after some other PRs broke polymorphization and we didn't notice, and we've yet to rebase and re-queue it.
>
> We've currently got the following open PRs:
>
> - #75675 (assigned to @**eddyb**) was opened to adjust the new symbol mangling scheme to encode impl parameters - this is an alternative fix for #75326 (which was originally resolved by #75518 and then #75595 - which changed polymorphization's analysis to mark more parameters are used). It's works but one of the tests required normalization that didn't differ based on bitness, which was unexpected and we've yet to decide how to proceed.
>
> - #75737 (blocked, but approved by @**eddyb**) was opened to remove the predicate logic in polymorphization's analysis. This logic was added during the original polymorphization PR (and then extended in #75518 and #75595) and isn't necessary after #75675 (which is why it is blocked). Other changes to polymorphization must have affected the necessity of this logic, since I'm confident that the new symbol mangling scheme wasn't the original impetus for it, but I'm not sure which changes those would have been.
>
> - #75414 (assigned to @**eddyb**) changes polymorphization's analysis to take an `InstanceDef`, which enables the MIR of shims to be polymorphized. I'm not sure if it is exactly what we want.
>
> - #75346 (assigned to @**nikomatsakis**) changes how `FnPtrShim`s are constructed so that they don't require substitution during codegen - this will help avoid double substitution from polymorphization changes.
>
> We've also got the following issues open:
>
> - #75327 would remove `ParamEnv::reveal_all()` from codegen, a necessary next step so that we can construct `ParamEnv`s that constrain generic parameters by their size (eventually) - this is the first step towards polymorphization by size/alignment.
>
> - #75336 suggests re-applying some changes from #75255 that we reverted (in #75337) because it caused regressions (the crux of this issue is fixing those regressions). #75255 modified the closure upvar tuple so that if it contained closures, those would be polymorphized - this was necessary to avoid issues that were revealed when the new symbol mangling scheme was used ([#t-compiler/wg-polymorphization>symbol mangling v0 ✕ polymorphisation](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/216091-t-compiler.2Fwg-polymorphization/topic/symbol.20mangling.20v0.20.E2.9C.95.20polymorphisation) discussed this issue initially). After chatting with eddy, I'm not sure that approach #75255 implemented is desirable - we've experimented with changing how the polymorphization analysis treats closures, and with attempts to reveal other issues that this could be a symptom of - we haven't had any luck with that though. Anyway, the changes that #75336 suggests polymorphizing closures anywhere in a `Instance`'s substs, not just in the upvar tuple because that would reduce duplication of more functions (see the example in the issue).
>
> - #69925 is fixed by #75346 above.
>
> - #75325 is probably the biggest unknown facing polymorphization right now and relates to how we handle the `type_id` and `type_name` intrinsics - which would make polymorphization observable. The issue contains some examples which were failing at one point with polymorphization enabled (I'm not sure if that's still the case). This issue requires a lot of investigation.
>
> I think that's everything. I think that landing the current PRs and addressing #75325 are the most important tasks right now, we can crater after that and hopefully try enabling polymorphization by default.

@_WG-polonius_ checkin by @**nikomatsakis** and @**lqd**

> The polonius WG (Niko, Albin, and Rémy) had a sprint at the beginning of August, where:
>
> - we continued the work on move errors: both in rustc to prepare the data needed to do the analysis and actually emit the errors computed by polonius, and in polonius itself, to fix potential false positives, and current efficiency issues in this part of the computation. Some new rules have been written but not yet fully implemented or tested, so this is something we'll continue to look at in the next sprint.
> - we were able to prototype our different lifetime analysis, and evaluate it: there was an open question whether it'd be better to track subset relations or equality relations, and we were able to find some subtle flaws in our current thoughts about tracking equality. There's some interesting theoretical core that could be useful in the future, but also has foundational issues, so we decided to keep tracking subset relations for now and not change our existing lifetime analysis rules.
> - we continued the work on universal region errors / illegal subset errors: we settled a tiny open question on whether we should compute these errors using subset relations or by looking for unexpected loans in universal regions. We decided to switch to using subset relations because it works everywhere: the polonius analysis is currently split into different parts for validation and efficiency reasons. Our existing subset errors computation had only been added to the main rules used for validation, and it used the "looking at unexpected loans" approach. We did the work necessary to update this, and also to compute the errors in the other parts dedicated to efficiency.
> - we were able to work on a fix for the current OOMs we see in a couple rustc UI tests (during fact generation): we have prototyped a fix in rustc and polonius. It is, however, quite invasive and requires subtle duplication of rules. So we also started looking at a different fix which could avoid that, and is something we'll continue to look at in the next sprint.
> - we did our periodic reevaluation of rustc UI tests using the polonius compare mode: find which tests might have changed .stderr files, add the ones missing for the tests added recently, etc; since the compare mode is not run on CI yet, we do this manually every few months to keep up to date with diagnostics changes and the likes. This time, a new test OOMs for move errors and will be fixed as part of this work mentioned earlier.
> - finally, we also looked at supporting profiling polonius' internals from rustc's -Zself-profile, and also when using the tracy profiler.
