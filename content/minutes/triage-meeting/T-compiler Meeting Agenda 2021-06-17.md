### WG checkins

@_wg-incr-comp_ by @**pnkfelix** and @**Wesley Wiser**:

> While there has been activity recently around the ICEs in incremental compilation in 1.52 and 1.53, the group itself has not been very active.

@_WG-llvm_ by @**nagisa** ([last update](https://hackmd.io/w9tJSQkHTZWYet3BUijtTA#WG-checkins)):

> - Work on opaque pointer types has recently picked up. Don't think it will be ready for next release, but maybe the one after. We should probably get rid of our reliance on pointer element types in codegen_llvm at some point.
> - A lot of mailing list discussion on pointer provenance wrt pointer<->int conversions (including implicit casts through memory) recently. It doesn't look like there's any consensus yet, but at least there is some movement.
> - A support for demangling symbols that use new Rust mangling scheme.

## Backport nominations

[T-compiler stable](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Abeta-nominated+-label%3Abeta-accepted+label%3AT-compiler) / [T-compiler beta](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aall+label%3Astable-nominated+-label%3Astable-accepted+label%3AT-compiler)

- :beta: "Revert "Allow specifying alignment for functions"" [rust#86300](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/86300)

  - opened by @**Hans Kratz**
  - [mild perf regression](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86196#issuecomment-860443448) on target Apple with disabled frame pointer elimination (clang default on macOS: `frame-pointer="no-leaf""`, in Rust nightly became `frame-pointer="all"`) along with an increase in binary size
  - (assigned `P-high` but - if appropriate for a Tier 1 platform - maybe reprio to `P-critical`

### P-high stable regression (which we don't usually discuss)

- Compile error: static lifetime not satisfied but it is [#86172](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86172)
  - opened by @**Jack Rickard**
  - compact [mcve](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86172#issuecomment-860236692)
  - looks like fallout from an old merge [#73905](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73905)
  - assigned `P-high` to get visibility, does `P-medium` is a better fit (or maybe nominate?)

## Performance logs

[triage logs for 2021-06-16](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-06-16.md)

The highlight of this week was a huge performance gains in some async focused benchmarks from only pretty-printing generator witness in verbose mode. This improved async heavy benchmarks by as much as 75%.

Triage done by **@rylev**.

1 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 0 Mixed
0 of them in rollups

#### Regressions

Make copy/copy_nonoverlapping fn's again [#86003](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86003)

- Moderate regression in [instruction counts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=47d38752c65359e1f4558d7a06935982fb8b486f&end=eab201df7028ebb6812c0b1a01702ac6ecfcceed&stat=instructions:u) (up to 2.3% on `incr-patched: u8 3072` builds of `issue-46449-debug`)
- Regressions happening mostly in LLVM codegen which makes sense given that this moves from intrinsics to function calls which should produce more LLVM IR.
- Follow up conversation starts [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/86003#issuecomment-862210554).

#### Improvements

- Update cargo [#86207](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86207)
- Pretty print generator witness only in `-Zverbose` mode [#86240](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86240)

#### Nags requiring follow up

- Follow up from last week on regression in [#85343](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/85343#issuecomment-856819536)
- Follow up to regression in [#86003](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/86003#issuecomment-862210554).

## Nominated Issues

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-nominated+label%3AT-compiler)

- "Generate links to definition in rustdoc source code pages" [rust#84176](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/84176)
  - opened by @**GuillaumeGomez**, adds hyperlinks to navigate code in rustdoc
  - feature is [nightly-only and disabled by default](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/84176#issuecomment-821026882)
  - [Last T-compiler discussion](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/238009-t-compiler.2Fmeetings/topic/.5Badhoc.5D.202021-06-11.20unsound.20stdlib.20specialization.20and.201.2E53/near/242358093) was oriented to OK'ing the merge after the 1.53 release so we have more time to test/revert/etc.
- "Re-add support for parsing (and pretty-printing) inner-attributes in match body" [rust#85193](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/85193)
  - [discussed by T-lang](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/85193#issuecomment-852333730)

- "Emscripten wasm32 compilation broken" [rust#85821](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85821)
  - Compiling an Hello world with the new emscripten SDK version 2.0.10 trips into a removed stubbed function (`__gxx_personality_v0`) and dies.
  - With emscripten SDK version 2.0.9 still works because the stub is there
  - Nominated to find an owner: who has recently their hands in the wasm target (@\_\_**Alex Crichton** ? maybe a WG?)
- "SPARC - passing argument from C++ to Rust issue" [rust#86163](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86163)
  - opened by @psumbera
  - unsoundness on Tier 2 target `sparcv9-sun-solaris`
  - @**nagisa** comments this seems to be a [SPARCv9 64-bit ABI definition issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86163#issuecomment-857584194)
  - We have [an MCVE](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86163#issuecomment-859089923)
  - Should we prioritize this as a `P-high` (or higher?) and try to follow-up accordingly? Who can own this?
