### P-critical

- "Unsoundness due to variance of trait objects WRT associated types" [#71550](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/71550)
  - This issue is assigned to @**spastorino** and has an [PR open](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71896).
  - Crater run from the fix suggested 16 non-spurious regressions.
  - Niko suspects we should land the PR, at the start of a release cycle.
  - We are starting a new cycle, so should we merge?.
- "Trait object with non-static lifetime is accepted where static lifetime is expected and required" [#72315](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/72315)
  - This issue is related to the previous one, and fixed by the same [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71896).
- "LLVM error: "Instruction does not dominate all uses!" on Windows" [#72470](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/72470)
  - Assigned to @**pnkfelix**
  - It is also a regression
    - supposedly injected by [PR #71840](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71840)
  - Rejects valid code.
  - It's windows only.
  - This seems to indicate incorrect MIR being generated.
  - We've decided to revert.
- "ICE when structurally matching a struct containing an associated type on latest Nightly." [#72896](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/72896)
  - Detected one day after the nightly release
  - Breaks valid code
  - Assigned to @**lcnr**

### Unassigned P-high regressions

There are no unassigned P-high regressions.

## Nominated Issues

- "tag/niche terminology cleanup" [#72497](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72497)
  - Nominated to determine if this is the terminology we want to use.
  - Assigned to @**eddyb**
- "Don't emit structure padding members if no padding is required." [#72541](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72541)
  - Nominated to determine if this is a patch we want to take.
    - @**eddyb** writes: "I don't think supporting SPIR-V is a plausible goal for the Rust LLVM backend, given all the limitations I've heard about. It would require a lot of transformation of anything involving memory IIRC."
  - Assigned to @**eddyb**
- "Implement `--extern-location`" [#72603](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72603)
  - Nominated:
    - to determine what process should we follow with this. MCP/RFC?
    - for visbility on the feature and to elicit review feedback.
  - Assigned to @**Matthew Jasper**
- "Cycle error through variance computation when using `-> _`." [#72730](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/72730)
  - (This is an issue)
  - @**eddyb** nominated "for discussion (on the topic of variance of "function item" types)."

- "`nth_back()` for `Zip` returns wrong values" [#68536](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/68536)
  - Nominated to determine how can we fix this problem and to raise awareness of it.

## WG checkins

@_T-compiler/WG-meta_ checkin by @**nikomatsakis** and @**spastorino**:

> - Merged the MCP RFC
> - Proposed meeting and elaborated some on the idea of "areas" of the compiler
> - Renamed ICE Breaker groups to notify groups
> - Working on creating a Windows notification group -- will likely pull the trigger soon

@_WG-mir-opt_ checkin by @**oli**:

> ## Major things
>
> - "dumb" NRVO optimization #72205
> - Const prop now works on user variables #71518
> - Thread local storage accesses are now a dedicated runtime operation (mir rvalue) #71192
> - Unused reads of discriminants are now removed, just like unused normal reads #70595
> - SimplifyLocals optimization is now run repeatedly to a fixed point #70755
> - All mir-opt tests are now `--bless`able #70721
> - Fearlessly optimize away constants #70820
> - mir-opt-level 0 doesn't run optional optimizations anymore #70073
> - MIR drop generation at MIR building time reworked into a structured scheme instead of ad-hoc generation #71840
> - `Operand::Copy` of `&mut T` is unsound #72093 #72820
>   - We now have a dedicated MIR validation pass that checks whether the result of your optimizations upholds a bunch of invariants. Please encode all invariants you can think of in this pass in addition to documentation.
>
> ## Interesting snippets
>
> - MIR can have multiple `return` terminators and everything is fine #72563
> - Make mir dumps less noisy #71200
> - More aggressively const prop aggregates, mutable variables and field accesses #72135 #71953
> - The `return` terminator is now treated as a read from `_0` (the return place) #72048
> - SimplifyArmIdentity can now run on mir-opt-level 1 #69756
